10/26/18, 3:46 PM - +91 98805 00667: This is still not cleared - any view by when this will get cleared?
10/26/18, 7:05 PM - +91 97405 83964: @919880715366 what happened? Did you even check? Now entire pole lights are.gone.
10/27/18, 10:07 AM - +91 98180 99754: Good morning Dear Bhasker 
Again sump went dry and motor on continuously.. any issue with water supply man? 
Expect the air block again in pipe lines !
10/27/18, 10:25 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Ashutosh, if you have an auto controller, the water levels both in sump and o/h tank are visible on the monitor. Not sure whether you have it or not, if not better get it installed. Also, please check for any leakages inside either in taps or commode flush tanks. The water release control being a common one for you and few others in that lane, this issue happening for only one is something strange.
10/27/18, 10:27 AM - +91 97390 99676: If you don't have a softner installed install one and get your flushes cleaned up.hard water scales end  up blocking the flushes in open position draining all the water
10/27/18, 10:55 AM - +91 98458 48331: Can I get the details of good and effective pest controller
10/27/18, 11:04 AM - +91 98805 00667: I also get this issue off and on - I have both water softener and auto controller installed
10/27/18, 11:07 AM - +91 98805 00667: What I think is that the  water pressure when sump is being filled is lower in houses closer to Wipro wall and higher as you move north. What this means is that it takes longer for some sump to fill up as against other sumps
Not sure if the solution though other than reaching out to bhaskar once in a while and getting sump filled
10/27/18, 11:11 AM - +91 97405 83964: Water pressure can't be that low. Could you plz check? For me, there was a lot of dirt inside the walve and once they cleared it, the water is filling very fast to ground floor sump.
10/27/18, 1:07 PM - JRVinay: Gentle reminder for tomorrow's (Sunday) AGM (sent as email by JRH)!

10/28/18, 7:36 AM - +91 97390 99676: The plastic burning smell can't be from this..I think we are under a two pronged attack..generator smoke from wipro and  plastic burning from dumpyard
10/28/18, 8:38 AM - +91 98180 99754: Thanks for inputs 
1st when we had the issue, we got contrôller installed
2nd time it happened, we got both oht and sump cleaned 
3rd time, (which was last was last month) the whole team came, spend good time and descaled piping as they could not find any leaks (including leak from sump)
*it is some design defect, when ever the tank gets empty, it gets air trapped in pipe line and pressure goes down from main line (the pressure from solar pipeline remains intact)
The person who open/closes water supply need to hv a check list (had it been leakage, issue would come every other day)
🙏🏻

Note on crackers;

1) Please do not burst crackers on the Paver roads, as it is very difficult to clean the marks.

2) Vacant plots may be used for the same, however the cracker debris need to be moved to the bins in the end.

3) Please follow court ruling strictly to burst crackers only between 8pm and 10pm, without any loud & stringed crackers.

4) Please keep in mind the pets and small kids in the project.

5) Please ensure that the rockets and any other form of air bombs are not directed to neighbouring Villas.

6) Request you to turn off all the bright diwali lights (except Diyas) in the Villa facades by 11 pm, to save electricity and help avoid any light pollution thru the night.

_Not a Forward. Not Promoting the brand._ 

Cleaner Gray water from homes leads to cleaner lakes resulting in rich water biodiversity and  organic produce grown on banks of lakes.

Dear Friends,

For our convenience Brics sales team has agreed to keep a stall every once a month along with cold pressed oil (nut based) from Sanatana Oils.

Please try these natural and organic products for a month.

Dreaming of chemical free Gray water from every home leading to less chemical usage in STP...
How beautiful it would be to see kids rolling on park lawn which is watered by chemical free STP water.😇

Will update on the date and timings of the sale in couple of days.

Thank you All.

11/18/18, 3:13 PM - +91 98451 90653: Is Airtel cellular network down?
11/18/18, 3:23 PM - JRSatish34: Up now
11/18/18, 3:36 PM - +91 70266 17733: It is still down for me... says no service on my phone still

11/18/18, 3:55 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: Any update on power connection to Wipro? Generators are still running all the time..  did we receive response from Wipro?
11/18/18, 5:42 PM - +91 97400 90335: Not sure if these are only generators, there are pumps as well. If the noise is from there it’s not likely to go with power connections
11/18/18, 5:42 PM - +91 97400 90335: We need definitive response onthe operating noise and pollution levels from them
11/18/18, 5:44 PM - +91 97400 90335: They have said they will plant trees and landscaping, that it will reduce noise and won’t look ugly. But the contractor said they have planned for a road and only 3 mtrs of landscaping. They have cut down the Neem tree near 79 as well
11/18/18, 5:45 PM - +91 97400 90335: <Media omitted>
11/18/18, 5:47 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: Landscape do not reduce noise levels and any bad smell from STP.
11/18/18, 5:51 PM - +91 97400 90335: Agree, was hoping for fewlayers of trees, at least it would have looked better
11/18/18, 6:09 PM - JRBabuDanny: Niranjan any update  Looks like they are testing our ear drum, not the generator
11/18/18, 6:23 PM - JRNiranjan: Sir, so far no response. We (MC) will schedule a meeting with Wipro's Mr.Rao this week and take this up

11/20/18, 7:02 AM - +91 98455 35339: Airtel still down?

11/20/18, 9:03 AM - +91 98805 00667: Looks like the load on their DG has increased- lot more smoke now as compared to few weeks back!
2 questions
1) any response to letter sent to Wipro
2) any confirmation on KPTCL power to Wipro by this month end- I believe that is what we were all hoping for!

11/20/18, 9:19 AM - JRNiranjan: Sir, WIpro has sent a letter last week to Association MC, will have it shared to the group.
11/20/18, 9:46 AM - JRBabuDanny: We hear noise continuously. It is not from DG. Anyone know what is the source of this?
11/20/18, 9:47 AM - +91 99805 44153: It is from the motors at the stp...
11/20/18, 9:49 AM - JRBabuDanny: MC members , we need to talk to them for dampening the sound. I am sure it is doable. If anyone wanted to get a feel come to 4th cross
11/20/18, 9:56 AM - JRHseOwnerJagan: Request help from MC towards this issue.  Wipro may react favourably  before start of Wipro operations  than later...
11/20/18, 10:24 AM - +91 97413 50506: It’s not only sound.... yday day time the entire house was vibrating while they were operating some motor
11/20/18, 10:30 AM - +91 97413 50506: Also they do some STP trial runs in the mornings and it stinks ....whatever technology they use
11/20/18, 10:30 AM - +91 97413 50506: Worried in how it will be once it is fully functional
11/20/18, 10:32 AM - +91 99805 44153: Yes the smell is unbearable ...
11/20/18, 10:37 AM - +91 99805 44153: They are using some heavy compacter/ roller to make the road adjacent to the wall....a lot of noise and yes building vibrates ...
11/20/18, 1:00 PM - JrGopal128Wood: This was brought to their notice & we have confirmation that the said usage has been stopped & will take in future too.
11/20/18, 1:06 PM - JrGopal128Wood: This letter only sought some additional time for response. In the meantime, Niranjan has called up & we have left messages with the Wipro team seeking a face to face meeting asap. Waiting for a confirmation back. Fyi
11/20/18, 1:18 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: Should we also highlight the expectations of trees to reduce the noise and pollution

If they have road there that will not be met.
11/20/18, 1:22 PM - +91 99805 44153: This message was deleted
11/20/18, 1:25 PM - +91 99805 44153: If they can plant 4 to 5 rows of those tall Ashoka trees it will provide a little relief from the pollution and will hide the structure behind. But with the road coming up I don't see where they will be able to plant trees

11/22/18, 11:06 AM - +91 97405 83964: I think if somebody can talk to them it will make logical sense for them as well as to leave just 1 ft space for trees. That would be good enough for creating the privacy as well as greenery.

11/22/18, 11:41 AM - +91 99021 72172: Just one feet😔 ??? For such a huge campus, min 10feet for trees I was dreaming.

We are sharing fence with their utility part (Genset,motors, stp, probably a truckbay too).
 Hope Wipro does not ignore landscaping on this side. ..and just plant ornamental palms and lawn as green scape.
11/22/18, 12:04 PM - JRBabuDanny: MC members, are we talking to Wipro on this subject?
11/22/18, 12:17 PM - +91 99021 72172: Pollution through air is something which everyone has to face in three to four km radius...was hoping with trees there would be some relief, not mentioning pain of birds (who cannot even complain😢) ....

11/22/18, 10:56 PM - JrGopal128Wood: We have confirmation from Wipro team that there is going to be tree lining along the boundary wall. A landscape expert is working on it. We will get to know the details of it sometime soon. Our wishlist too has been shared with that expert as we have been told.
11/23/18, 6:52 AM - +91 98805 00667: Thx - can you also share update if any on DG and sound

11/24/18, 7:36 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Good morning.. Baskar / Niranjan.. hope electrition either started or will start the work by 8.. the huge impact is no water at the overhead tank
11/24/18, 7:38 AM - JRAbhishek: @919880715366  the DG backup did not work in Phase 2 post evening. Get it checked.
11/24/18, 7:38 AM - JRHimanshu: Yes... Same in our house too.  Please let us know by what time this resolution is planned.
11/24/18, 9:38 AM - +91 96633 05410: Any update on this please..It's a real struggle to survive without electricity !!
11/24/18, 9:49 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Is there an alternative option, temporary to feed the normal electronic power from other feeds to pump the water to overhead tank?
11/24/18, 9:52 AM - +91 98809 06432: Same challenge with us. Need urgent help. It's almost 2 days in this state
11/24/18, 9:53 AM - JRSatish34: Ashok JRG Waterman.vcf (file attached)
11/24/18, 9:53 AM - JRSatish34: You would need a standalone motor to pump water to OHT. Try calling Ashok.
11/24/18, 9:54 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Is the problem to out internal wiring / utilities.. or something at the BESCOM level? Is there a compliant already made with BESCOM?
11/24/18, 9:54 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Thanks Sathish.
11/24/18, 10:41 AM - +91 96633 05410: Are other electrical points working fine for you guys (except the high voltage ones..)..For me regular lights are also flickering and internet not working .
11/24/18, 10:42 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Same here
11/24/18, 10:42 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Few lights are not working
11/24/18, 10:42 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Other than home appliances
11/24/18, 10:49 AM - +91 99800 07918: Same for us
11/24/18, 10:57 AM - +91 98809 06432: Does any one know if RTOs (specifically Begur one) will be closed today (don't know if they are closed on 2nd and 4th Sat)?
11/24/18, 11:30 AM - JRAbhishek: Déjà vu Puneet ! I am here at the RTO.
11/24/18, 11:30 AM - JRAbhishek: it’s open.
11/24/18, 1:37 PM - JR18Jayakumar: Thank you for the fix. Now power back and pumping the water.
11/24/18, 1:39 PM - JR18Jayakumar: Looks like again the cause is something related to the feeder box at the end of 2nd cross...
11/24/18, 2:00 PM - JRNiranjan: Sir, Issue is resolved in 2nd Cross. We have checked on the feeder box as well. We will need ensure that all the feeder boxes are locked and no temporary wires are allowed directly from these boxes.
11/24/18, 2:01 PM - JRRahul: Who has taken the temporary connection from this feeder box?
11/24/18, 2:02 PM - JRRahul: Curious to also know why there is a temporary connection going from the clubhouse
11/24/18, 2:03 PM - +91 98867 97696: Is the power back in club house?
11/24/18, 2:25 PM - +91 95356 33113: Is Airtel broadband down?

11/24/18, 2:30 PM - +91 95356 33113: Ok, I guess my modem is one more casualty of the power fluctuation!
11/24/18, 2:53 PM - +91 98809 06432: Thank you Niranjan !
11/24/18, 2:55 PM - +91 98809 06432: Though some of the electronics have called us goodbye in these two fluctuating days ..
11/24/18, 2:59 PM - JRNiranjan: Sorry to hear that Sir. Ideally it should not happen, if there is a short circuit, the MCBs should trip. Looks like the in-between stage is the culprict.
11/24/18, 2:59 PM - JRNiranjan: We will have to check if everything is functional as the Club now.
11/24/18, 3:02 PM - +91 95351 88288: Thanks for visiting :)
11/24/18, 3:09 PM - +91 98805 00667: Gopal - can you pls share the update from meeting with Wipro. Eager to hear what Wipro has communicated on key issues of pollution and sound!
11/24/18, 3:20 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Meeting with Wipro team is yet to happen.
11/24/18, 3:55 PM - JR18Jayakumar: Here also same...

11/24/18, 9:39 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: Electricity connection has become now December end.? 
They response about the STP is not acceptable, because we have STP, doesn't absolve from running it without foul smell and noise. We should raise against this strongly.
11/24/18, 9:48 PM - +91 99021 72172: Thank you Niranjan.
Wish trees are beautiful Ashoka🌲🌲🌲🙂
11/24/18, 9:49 PM - +91 97400 90335: Very disappointing reply, just measured the noise levels it’s around 68db from my balcony. Accepted level is 45db at night
11/24/18, 9:49 PM - +91 97400 90335: <Media omitted>
11/24/18, 9:49 PM - JRNiranjan: Dear, Thats the communication shared with me, we will wait for the registered post.

11/24/18, 9:50 PM - +91 97400 90335: This with one generator and no guarantee that they will not operate more at the same time
11/24/18, 9:51 PM - +91 97400 90335: No word on noise reduction of STP motor as they mentioned to Gopal
11/24/18, 9:51 PM - JRNiranjan: Dear All, We will plan to meet once we receive the registered post to Association next week. 

It's not possible to discuss this topic over this group.
11/24/18, 9:53 PM - +91 97400 90335: With th current space they have left, at best have one line of Ashoka trees which is not going to be adequate, expected more details from them
11/24/18, 9:56 PM - JRBabuDanny: Let us have the meeting at the earliest. Bring them near 4th cross and get their opinion on the noise level. What is our alternate plan if they are adamant
11/24/18, 10:11 PM - +91 98863 56584: This response is disappointing. We have been very patient till now based on the assurance given to us earlier. But the comments show complete indifference to our concerns on noise from generators and stp, foul smell from stp and pollution from generators. We need to meet them at the earliest.
11/25/18, 6:52 AM - JRSrini: Hi Niranjan,
The point of encroachment is also worrying. Now, that they had put it on paper, we need to know if this is true. If yes, we would like to know the details.

Wipro have damaged pillars of Villa 27 and we don’t want them to get away in the name of encroachment.
11/25/18, 7:23 AM - JRRahul: I agree, this point has been to put us on the back foot. What are the facts and our stand on this?
11/25/18, 7:26 AM - JRRahul: If there had been a wall made on our side built earlier, demaracation of the boundaries would have been absolutely clear with no questions of encroachment coming up.
11/25/18, 7:32 AM - JRRahul: Points made for STP in the letter are downright frivolous. Claims of "latest/best" tech is just hyperbole unless concrete details are shared.
11/25/18, 7:32 AM - JRRahul: We need to have an urgent meeting to discuss what we plan to do next.
11/25/18, 7:49 AM - +91 98863 56584: Meanwhile stink from stop continues... Can't stand it continuously
11/25/18, 8:25 AM - JRSrini: Since this is a written allegation, we should respond back to them in writing, to avoid any legal actions in future. 

May I request association to take point & ensure we send an appropriate written response?
11/25/18, 9:01 AM - +91 99808 47825: +1
11/25/18, 9:03 AM - JRNiranjan: Dear All, Please wait for the written communication sent to Association by reg post. We shall meet on this and respond appropriately. We don't need to react.
11/25/18, 9:22 AM - JRNiranjan: Also, encroachment is being referred to is about few of the Villa grills being rested on their compound wall.

Improper setback is being referred to the car portico columns, which are constructed  at the edge of the plot, instead of leaving 1 meter setback from the boundary.

11/27/18, 12:37 PM - JRSachin: But we need to check what kind of support available for DG.. too many problems right from installation

11/27/18, 4:25 PM - +91 96324 79094: Is Airtel back

11/28/18, 7:13 PM - +91 99450 27635: @ 202. Got a notification on MyGate for Pizza delivery from Dominos We have not placed any order. The security personnel allowed an entry without my approval. Apparently the pizza delivery guy told the security personnel that he has the verbal permission from me and insisted that he has called me up. Which of course he hadn’t. Also I was sent the check out notification for the same. I got to know of all this when I called the security gate to figure out what was going on as I had got messages for check in and out without approving for any visitor/vendor. This could pose a problem as someone can enter the community without any approval. Just thought I should share it here so that adequate measures can be taken to avoid this happening in future and avoid a security breach. Thanks
11/28/18, 7:26 PM - +91 90196 85428: The order was mine.. and the delivery person called me that security is denying to which I spoke to security and told him to make the entry again and send him. But the person was sent just like that
11/29/18, 10:45 AM - +91 95351 88288: Anyone going towards dommasandra in another 10/15 mints?

11/29/18, 6:45 PM - +91 97405 83964: @919886680614 now all poles lights are not working at tennis court.
11/29/18, 6:46 PM - +91 97405 83964: Yesterday Bhaskar said, he will call Shankar. Today, he is not picking up my phone.
11/29/18, 7:03 PM - JRNiranjan: Sir, we are awaiting for response from tennis court vendor to attend to this. Shall update tomorrow. Shankar is not able to fix the issue.

Ps: Tomorrow will be Bhaskar's last day as JR Greenwich maintenance man !
11/29/18, 7:07 PM - +91 97405 83964: Issue now is that none of the lights are working. I suspect some fuse or loose connection for the lights which were working till yesterday. 

One pole lights which we are trying to get it fixed by tennis vendor is a different issue.
11/29/18, 7:29 PM - +91 99021 72172: Dear Bhaskar, Thanks for everything..All the best 🙂 ..

12/2/18, 11:14 AM - +91 88053 29549: Anyone used 5 amp to 15 amp converter in JRGW 5 amp sockets? Is the wiring same in both lines ?  I got by mistake an iron box which needs 15 amp
12/2/18, 11:14 AM - +91 88053 29549: Was checking if I should replace or use converter
12/2/18, 11:16 AM - +91 95356 33113: Depends on what the current draw of the iron is. You risk melting the wires if it draws more than 6A. The wire gauge is different for the two socket types.
12/2/18, 11:16 AM - +91 88053 29549: Ok
12/2/18, 11:16 AM - +91 88053 29549: So replacement is good option... Thanks...

12/7/18, 8:56 AM - +91 98809 06432: Small or big ..depends upon the traffic pileup. Luckily, there was no such congestion today
12/7/18, 8:57 AM - +91 98809 06432: But I think, BBMP is yet to do their "proper" digging and work at the place
12/7/18, 8:58 AM - +91 98809 06432: Let us wait and watch ..if situation worsens ..
12/7/18, 9:01 AM - +91 96202 12548: It's fine now. But whoever dug it up did a pretty nasty job of closing it.
12/7/18, 9:02 AM - +91 96202 12548: Now only hope is that  Santa Clause may come and fix it properly.
12/7/18, 9:02 AM - +91 97390 99676: Unless his sledge gets stuck on the way😁😁

12/9/18, 3:11 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: I am sure most of you have got it installed water  softener  at homeI- could you unicsdt feedback please and contact person name ?
12/9/18, 3:42 PM - JRSanthosh: Most of the water softeners in JR are 
Chemical based.. including the  one in our house.. these need recharging every 2 months and result in water wastage as well as  hazardous water release to the ground...
This Sunday we are going to call a demo for another kind of softener which breaks the water by  physical property and is maintenance free for about 10 years..
If interested pls attend the demo in the coming week end
12/9/18, 3:43 PM - +91 97318 77400: Is/was this today or next Sunday?
12/9/18, 3:44 PM - +91 96202 12548: 👍

12/9/18, 7:33 PM - +91 96202 12548: Yeah. No power and no street lights.
12/9/18, 8:23 PM - +91 96202 12548: No power for the last 3 hours. Anybody knows why?
12/9/18, 8:43 PM - JRRahul: The whole of kodathi was dark, looka like some major breakdown
12/9/18, 8:45 PM - JRSunil: any idea why street lights r not on DG
12/9/18, 8:52 PM - JRBabuDanny: Any idea what is the continuous sound we are hearing(not from generator, STP motor)
12/9/18, 9:04 PM - +91 96202 12548: The electrician is here looking into this. But he is not able to figure out.
12/9/18, 9:26 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Bhaskar could speak to someone in BESCOM who mentioned about a major breakdown in transmission line which they are working on. Will take about 3 hours more to restore
12/9/18, 9:27 PM - JRAbhishek: thanks for the update Gopal👍🏻
12/9/18, 9:27 PM - +91 96202 12548: Thanks for the update.
12/9/18, 9:30 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Possibly, the fluctuation from the tripping led to some issue with the control switch of the street lights. An outside electrician who came could not identify the problem....so we will be without the streetlights while the DG is on.
12/9/18, 9:46 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Will join - thanks
12/9/18, 9:53 PM - +91 98863 56584: Some trucks running continuously. It seems last night they were on through out.

JRG Audit sub-committee is going through further financial details but in meantime deposits from all members  are crucial to continue community maintenance activities.

12/11/18, 8:45 AM - +91 99728 07440: @919880715366 the water pressure in the sump is extremely low.. sump is not even getting half full.  I called the plumber and got the walve cleaned twice already. He says there may be issues in the main walve which needs to be checked with you. Please check..
12/11/18, 9:06 AM - +91 78996 46443: <Media omitted>
12/11/18, 9:13 AM - JRNiranjan: Sure Madam.
12/11/18, 9:17 AM - +91 98805 00667: I do not think it is a valve issue - have gone through all those cycles a few times already - at least my conclusion is that water pressure is low when water is released and it improves closer to 6:30pm - this leads to sump never getting full for me as well. Every 10 days or so, i need bhaskar‘s help to get sump filled completely
Need a longer term solution to this problem for villas closer to Wipro wall
12/11/18, 9:20 AM - +91 99808 47825: I would think, it is valid for villas that are far from main tank in that order. It might get solved if the timing can be increased for release. We have the same experience.
12/11/18, 9:22 AM - +91 98805 00667: Agreed
12/11/18, 9:24 AM - +91 99728 07440: There are float ball valve in sumps so water overflow in sumps should not be an issue for sumps which are closer to the tank.. timing should be increased.. btw, anyone knows what is timing for water inlet currently?

12/11/18, 9:28 AM - +91 98805 00667: Time is -4:30 to 6:30

I do not think overflow is a issue
12/11/18, 9:34 AM - +91 98863 56584: We have a similar issue at 79.
12/11/18, 9:40 AM - +91 96202 12548: We should have a pressure pump installed to increase the force of the water released from the main tank.

12/14/18, 8:47 PM - JRVinay: Dear All,
As promised, please find below the details of account number and IFSC code for remittance of 10 months interim maintenance amount. As mentioned in our earlier email, in discussion with the Bank, we have created a virtual account for each of the Villa/site owner. Any remittance into this account gets transferred into association main account after recording the concerned owners' details which helps in track, trace & accounting. To be doubly sure, few of the committee members have tested their respective virtual accounts by remitting money & the transactions / reports are coming out the way we wanted. So please note the account number methodology as mentioned below along with few examples, note down what should be your account number and just use only that as your account number while remitting money.  

ACCOUNT NUMBER : *JRGSHOAXXX*  ( Where *XXX* denotes your villa number and are the only numbers in ac no.)

Examples:
for Villa #1 account number will be *JRGSHOA001* 
for Villa #57 account number will be *JRGSHOA057* 
for Villa #128 account number will be *JRGSHOA128* 

IFSC Code : *FDRL0002171* 

Additional details (just in case needed) :

Beneficiary Name: JR Greenwich Site And House Owners Association

Bank : *FEDERAL BANK* 

Branch : KODATHI GATE

If you have any other query or doubts regarding creating your account number, please PM/email to us & we will be happy to assist you. Appreciate your cooperation and support. Thanks 

Regards,
Management Committee

Participants can also play some games based on their interest like Housie/Tambola (PM me if any other ideas for this event).
Let us encourage all our Seniors to attend this to have a good acquaintance among themselves
*Please msg me with the count of people interested to attend this*

To take this discussion further and to finalize the logistics, join our JR Greenwich - Seniors WhatsApp group at https://chat.whatsapp.com/7syiidms1g7CzQJ3ihY6Dp

12/21/18, 9:10 AM - JRVinay: Dear All, Thanks for bank transfer of 10 months interim maintenance deposit. A gentle reminder in case you have not completed the deposit for your respective villa/plot. There is very good response from members but 100% transfers are required to close this activity at earliest and also will help association to focus on other activities, some of which are very critical in nature.

Also would like to appreciate our treasurer Gopal - he has been instrumental to the whole process and worked meticulously with bank since step one which required lots of  time and  background work including going through all the technicality, physical visits, follow ups and much more. So our thanks to  him  for making it a smooth and convenient experience for everyone🙂

Wish all the members and families Happy holidays, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Regards,
Management Committee

12/24/18, 9:08 PM - +91 98805 00667: Any update - complete darkness in this part o 3rd cross!!
12/24/18, 11:23 PM - +91 98863 96197: Dear Mr Niranjan , 
Tonight again we have a blackout in Phase 2 and DG backup . It’s a little sad that this problem has not been sorted since the day I have come to stay in JR . If I would have known that this is going to be a perennial problem I would have thought twice to buy the property.  My previous residence had 550 flats but rarely a problem of power backup, here it’s the reverse. 

Also it’s not the first time a complaint on this is lodged . The apartment next door seems to have better backup and a more noisy DG than ours .
Regards 
Gautam (163)
12/25/18, 10:24 AM - JRNiranjan: Sir, 

We are sorry for the inconvenience caused. 

Like any other material purchase and installation, DG has been commissioned. Unfortunately we have to fallback on careless Vendors who hasn't been fixing this issue reported permanently.

I will also share the number with Association MC for further follow ups.
12/25/18, 10:28 AM - JRNiranjan: Also, with new Estate Manager appointed by Association taking charge from 1st January will help keep track of such maintenance activities going forward.

12/26/18, 8:55 AM - JRHimanshu: @919886356584 Did this work for you... Or did you try some other way.
12/26/18, 8:56 AM - +91 98863 56584: I tried NEFT from SBI and it worked. Had to wait 4 days after payee registration.

12/27/18, 12:11 PM - +91 98863 96197: Dear Gopal ,

Is the amount I should transfer any different?

12/30/18, 1:32 PM - +91 99021 72172: Also before we go for individual units wanted to request  and CHK with association office bearers if this can be installed at layout level.

 Will share the quotation for your reference in few days.

Thanks
12/30/18, 2:56 PM - +91 98805 00667: One of the key needs is to ensure snakes don’t find breeding spaces - we need to clear the entire complex from all debris which exists in all empty plots apart from all residents ensuring clean spaces around them
12/30/18, 3:59 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: That would be ideal - layout installation will be 15 times atleast cheaper as a group  than individual installation but need to see effectiveness of physical model ( heard that if we do not use water for 48 hours , molecule gets formed hard again )
12/30/18, 4:24 PM - JRNiranjan: Dear All, Going forward for Party hall bookings at tye club house, please send out an email to jrgassociation@gmail.com and niranjan@jrhousing.com. Thank you.
12/30/18, 4:33 PM - JRNiranjan: NOTICE TO VILLAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Dear All,

Please send an email to jrgassociation@gmail.com with your floor plans, Panchayath /BDA approved sanction plans, copy of Sale deed, copy of construction agreement, approximate timeline for construction and also your contractor contact details.

Note: Above NOC is not applicable for interior works.

We kindly request you to complete the above formality as per the agreements executed and also as per the Association byelaws.
12/30/18, 4:35 PM - JRNiranjan: Note 2:
NOCs to be obtained within 15th January 2019, failing which the Association MC may stop such construction work at site.
12/30/18, 5:05 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Follow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GN9qSimYbx59QkoUxlpqPu
12/30/18, 5:06 PM - JRSudhakar: Niranjan - Any update about the sand fill adjacent to site 39? As per your updates, that land owner is supposed to clear it up this weekend. I don't see that happening.
12/30/18, 5:07 PM - JRSudhakar: One rain spell, the boundary wall might crash
12/30/18, 5:07 PM - JRSudhakar: Wall has already developed cracks
12/30/18, 5:07 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Created water softener group to get to know about good softener and deal
12/30/18, 5:36 PM - +91 98805 00667: Is there any associated cost as well?
12/30/18, 6:40 PM - JRNiranjan: Yes Sir, as listed in our byelaw book
12/30/18, 6:41 PM - JRNiranjan: We spoke to him and reminded him yesterday as well sir, we will follow up with him tomorrow
12/30/18, 6:42 PM - JrGopal128Wood: All, the MCB that supports the park lights & a part of the street lights is again having a short circuit. Hence these lights are not working right now.
12/30/18, 8:00 PM - JRDeepaliNaveen: Tennis court lights are left on, with no one around. Not sure where the switches are.
12/30/18, 8:13 PM - +91 97318 77400: Dear all, 

Please excuse me for the long message, but I wanted to share a personal story, not something that you would perhaps enjoy reading but nevertheless, here goes. I grew up in the IIT Madras campus, a lush 250 hectare area that was all one huge forest, and a good part of it still continues to be, although the proportion has gone down signficantly. 

Spotting snakes (and mongooses, monkeys, deer and fox) were all routine events (we even saw a crocodile once!). During my 20 years in the IIT campus, there have been reports of several poisonous (cobras, vipers, kraits) but mostly they were all non-poisonous snakes (rat snakes and green vine snakes). There were no casualties that I knew of (people even used to say that it was because of the famous Jalakandeshwara temple in the campus), until some years later. My neighbor (who was also my Biology teacher in school) was bitten by a venomous snake in her own garden. Due to the complications that arose from that, she has been crippled in her leg ever since. 

Just to put probabilities in perspective, we are talking about a life-altering incident that took place in a place with a lot fewer poisonous snake-encounters, a lot more green area (for the snakes to stay away from humans), and a lot less population density. Not to mention that there was access to an in-campus hospital with ambulance and anti-venom and zero traffic jams. Every single snake that we have spotted in JR Greenwich is in the Big Four. 

"Six years and no casualties" sounds more like a ticking time bomb than something to take pride in (btw, there has been one snake-bite incident already). Yes, we all trust and respect nature and the greater forces and our karmas. But there's also the science and the statistics and the common sense. 

Long story short, better safe than sorry should be our overarching goal. One that we should be proactively, collectively taking steps towards, no?
12/30/18, 8:20 PM - JRBirendraNetApp: Exactly ! We can't be waiting things to happen to do something more proactively. Other than keeping our surrounding clean and breaking to food chain that leads to snakes invite we are not getting any idea. There should be some way to sanitize the whole area !
12/30/18, 8:47 PM - +91 96633 05410: Thanks Sharanya for putting the right perspective bang on. We can just thank our stars for no casualties so far but by any standards,doesn't mean  taking no action  to avert any unfortunate event.However,I remember the last time this thread was on,there was a group formed and we even got someone to proactive look out for snakes(and two were caught) but it did not look very promising option.
May be needs more brainstorming along with some basic hygiene(debris clearing etc...)
12/30/18, 8:50 PM - DentalDrJrAarthi: 100% correct...Better to be safe than sorry
12/30/18, 9:50 PM - +91 97418 32223: Well written @919731877400 . Totally agree with your concluding remarks.
12/30/18, 10:00 PM - +91 98451 90653: At minimum, all debris from across the layout should be cleaned - it is all a breeding ground.
At least that is within our control to get done?
12/30/18, 10:55 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Can we ask snake catchers to suggest  ways to prevent snake coming in this area - heard there are plantation which keeps snake away and we can ensure snake food is not easily available in layout - frog, etc ..

We can have one small group who ensure actions are taken to prevent this , we can not stop completely though since we are surrounded by wipro where continuous excavation happening and other side open empty land ..something is better than sitting without doing anything
12/30/18, 11:18 PM - +91 98863 96197: Can’t we invite the snake catchers for an inspection every month to keep control on any new snake population ( for next six months say) ?
12/30/18, 11:25 PM - +91 97318 77400: +1 

And also have a fool proof contingency plan for what to do in case of a  snake bite.

 Thanks to @jaya and  others, we have a well compiled list of snake catchers to call when we see a snake. 

But we all need to be educated on what to do in case of a snake bite, say at 6pm on a weekday,  when even crossing wipro takes a good 1 hour. 

First aid, maybe a set of people who know what to do (in case parents are still in office), can we ask nearest clinics to keep anti venoms handy? Is it possible for one of our resident doctors to be trained in this treatment? I know some of you already have done some survey on this.. Would be helpful if you could please share.
12/31/18, 1:25 AM - JRNiranjan: Madam, we would be interested to know the measures taken by IIT Madras campus team did to avert the danger, during those 20 years :).
12/31/18, 1:53 AM - +91 99021 72172: Long back I was giving Gyan to Gardener Jagadish not to kill snakes ( he gives them proper funeral🙂 ), he rubbished me by saying - I take care of my young ones and they take care of theirs ...simple clarity.

Question is do I coexist with rats, cockroaches, termites, strays now snakes..kill anything, it is all same as I am not killing for food.

Once Wipro wall, permanent wall with raised height next to villa 39 and better perimeter walls on all side  is done calling scouts makes sense.

+++ for Debris clearance.

+++++ For filling rat holes, right now I have one in my lawn 

Russell's Viper is a scary dude 1:52am and I am replying haha
12/31/18, 4:28 AM - +91 97318 77400: They didn't have to do much thanks to the clean separation there was between the human zone and the woods.  That little area that was at the intersection was of course clean and debris-free. Here our situation of coexisting is quite different unfortunately because we are having to host Russel Vipers right at our doorsteps, and share walking tracks with them every evening!
12/31/18, 6:18 AM - JRBirendraNetApp: +1
12/31/18, 7:18 AM - +91 99021 72172: Let's have Mongoose too which eat snake eggs.🙂 All 30 to 40 eggs which a cobra or Russel's viper lays will be hatched, with no snake predator around.

Please insist on *better and hole proof perimeter walls* .

Debris clearance. 

Fill rat holes.
12/31/18, 8:06 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Good morning, on account of New Year's holiday, no garbage clearance tomorrow.
12/31/18, 8:29 AM - +91 98805 00667: Debris cleaning and proactive rat holes closure - this is something which can get attempted immediately.
@919886680614??
12/31/18, 9:32 AM - JRNiranjan: Sir, We will start the routine debris clearance this week starting from 2nd January. Our new estate manager also would take charge tomorrow.
12/31/18, 9:45 AM - +91 98805 00667: Thanks niranjan
12/31/18, 10:45 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Dear all, the concerns specific to snakes are valid but please review few points below :
1. Multiple suggestions as a preventive measure were made in the past each time a snake was spotted/caught. A sub-committee was set up to discuss ways and means. A snake catcher by name snake Babu was invited who appeared one of the evenings & went around our layout. Some  committee members & interested residents    joined him. He caught 3 snakes that day - one cobra at the STP, one Viper from the debris near villa 12&13 under construction and a second cobra by magic by the catcher's assistant which need not be discussed here. Once the exercise was over, we learnt the following :
(a) all the boasting the catcher exhibited initially that he could follow snake's trails and can even pull out a snake from a rat hole etc  remained a hype and just a marketing tool of his profession. Our learning was echoed by Mr. Prithvi (the snake expert with more than10 years of research experience) and Mr.Kartik ( a trained snake catcher). Both these experts have told us that there is nothing called following the trails/smell of snakes and catching them and if someone says so, he is purely a business minded guy. 
(b) While going around the layout, Babu, Prithvi & Kartik showed us many hiding places for the snakes viz. Piled up debris, clusters of construction blocks/materials, open areas in the compound wall,  drainage lines, lawns etc, flower pots in clusters kept in the set back areas of Villas as well as some plants that are very bushy having no ground clearance, utilities which had piled up items & so on. 
(c) while follow up for debris clearance was a routine item in the residents meeting or WhatsApp, JRH has been doing that excercise periodically and in the recent meeting too, Niranjan had committed to do that which he re-iterated today as a response to multiple requests. If you all remember, a maison was deployed by Bhaskar for a few days exclusively to plug all visible open areas which too was completed. If some more have surfaced now due to the rodents' night duty, we need to plug them as well.
(d) can all the individual Villa owners look around the set back & utility area and act on the grey areas mentioned in (c) above ?
2. Realising Mr.Prithvi's experience/expertise could come in handy to address/answer many a concerns/questions the residents had, with due notice and reminders, we arranged for an interactive session with him. While the attendance was not discouraging, certainly it was not in tune with the topic much talked about. Sorry to say that most of the concerns/suggestions that got pumped in since yesterday were addressed in that session in terms of practicality, implementability etc. Due to the very nature of the session and many slides etc used, we could not write a detailed note but key points were sent as takeaways. One point was on children wearing full jeans and sports shoes while at play on grassy park - how many do follow this ?
Also, there was a general check list that was sent in the group - a week later when I happened to speak to a resident about it, I was asked " is it, I did not see it & can you resend?". 
Sorry for the long message & no offense meant. Wanted to put things in their right perspective lest we be seen as doing nothing in spite of highlighting an issue. The sub-committee is being expanded with few more people & a meeting of it will be held soon in the new year. A very happy new year to all of you & family.

Thanks !
12/31/18, 1:46 PM - JRVinay: Intercom guy is at main gate... Please call 9000 to check for your villa.
12/31/18, 4:11 PM - +91 97318 77400: Thanks Aastha and Gopal. This is a great resource for prevention. But I think one important point that is still missing is an action plan in case of a bite. Taking to the nearest hospital is not a very convincing answer. We need to know which are the nearest hospitals that carry anti venom (I believe they don't all carry it?). What happens in case of traffic jam. Is it possible to have somebody come and administer treatment? Is there any first aid. There needs to be an emergency medical plan. Like how everybody needs to know how to give a CPR. Or like using an epipen/inhaler for allergy. I'm not able to find much online, there are two versions to everything I read. Once this is resolved, I think it will keep us all mentally at peace, while attending to the preventive measures.
12/31/18, 4:14 PM - +91 97318 77400: And no offense taken :) Coming to think of it, it will be handy to have all JRG related documents saved in a common online location (not only WhatsApp), as a ready reference. The association's Google drive? (Or is it already there 😬)
12/31/18, 4:37 PM - +91 98865 51312: Great job in getting this streamlined.. transferred 50k for villa # 97. Please confirm when received.
12/31/18, 4:41 PM - JRVenu: Have a Gmail account... Will have these among other documents we will copy to Google drive
12/31/18, 4:44 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Prithvi's session covered answers to most part of your questions except the issue of traffic jam. I have his presentation files in a pen drive which can be uploaded in a shared folder for everyone to see after the sub-committee meeting . In the meantime, the answers to couple of key questions :
1. The best nearby hospital to address a snakebite is Sakra, which has a good team + anti-venom in stock. Prithvi was not sure about Columbia Asia - Iblur but an enquiry with the emergency department there indicates they too treat such cases.
2. Not sure whether govt hospitals nearby or any small hospitals keep the anti-venom in stock since the same has temperature controlled storage needs, has shelf life issue + needs a team that knows when to administer. More to discuss as part of the sub-committee meeting. Thx
12/31/18, 5:15 PM - +91 97318 77400: Thanks Gopal. I have several concerns/questions. Anyways we can discuss this during the sub committee meeting.
1/1/19, 12:21 AM - JRVenu: Wish you all a happy and prosperous 2019. May this year bring you joy and happiness that you truly deserve.

1/2/19, 8:51 AM - JRVenu: Dear Residents and Friends,
During some of the earlier discussions a few of you have shown interest to contribute (in kind) to the clubhouse.  I wanted to send out a broader email to the community to see if you have unused "furniture and electronics" that could be used at the JRG Clubhouse.  
If you have something that you feel might be of use… please reach out to either myself, Gopal or Vinay so that we can evaluate the items and see how best they will be meeting the needs.
Last thing we should do it have items that just add with limited impact.
Thank you all in advance and have a great day.

Regards,
JRG Management Committee

1/2/19, 10:06 AM - JRAbhishek: :-).  I was planning to give my Domyos Treadmill.
1/2/19, 10:09 AM - JRVenu: 🙂 🙂 Thanks for the offer... but that was not exactly the furniture we was to give our security of estate manager... 🙂 🙂
1/3/19, 12:57 PM - JRVinay: Dear All, Thanks for the bank transfer of 10 months interim maintenance deposit received from majority of the members. Given the association's hands full with good number of overflowing tasks along with very limited time, energy, resources --- request you to complete deposit in case you have not done for your respective villa/plot to close this important activity at earliest with 100% transfers, and help avoiding follow up/s which need to be the last thing association should be doing due to available very narrow bandwidth/limitations. This would help to instead focus on other critical activities. Also this is one of the critical milestones to help setting up strong and transparent association and requires cooperation from every member to achieve this.

Please refer bye-laws, guidelines and other relevant documents shared earlier for details. If still have any further query or doubt, please PM/email & we will be happy to assist you.

Once again wish all the members and families Happy New Year and appreciate for being part of association and supporting this crucial transition/building phase.

Regards,
Management Committee

It is that time of the year... Some call it pongal, some sankranti, some Makara sankranti, some lohri, and many more different names.... But all comes down to festivals and celebrations. This year we are planning on celebrating on 19 Jan (sat) so that most can join. I will create a WhatsApp group call "JRG Sankranti 2019" and will invite as many people to join the celebrations as possible. Please register and mention the number of adults and kids (under 12 years) that will be joining. As before we want to have breakfast and continue celebrations until lunch time.

More details to follow.

1/8/19, 11:05 AM - JRVinay: Dear All, In response to demand of "April18-Jan19"---10 months' interim maintenance payment due, the response has been encouraging with a significant number of members already  remitting the money starting from the second week of December 2018 and leaving only a few more to follow suit. To be fair to the members who have already remitted, the MC has now decided to set a deadline for receiving the balance money as 15th January 2019. Our earnest aim would be to achieve this goal without individual follow ups, however, the MC may choose to send daily reminders from 10th January onwards depending on the status of pending payments.

Please refer bye-laws, guidelines and other relevant documents shared earlier for details and all members are require to make payment for their respective villa/plot.

Once again request the remaining members  to help us close this activity by 15th Jan19 which will enable us to concentrate on the rest of the planned activities.

Regards,
Management Committee

Please contact him for the same.
1/13/19, 11:24 AM - +91 98863 56584: We are facing this issue for last one week.  But yesterday I had to call a tanker to meet my immediate need. We need a solution for houses near the wipro wall. The inflow/pressure is not sufficient. I checked it multiple times.
1/13/19, 11:29 AM - +91 98805 00667: This problem exists for many houses specially as u go closer to Wipro wall!!
In the past bhaskar has helped get water opened but  bhaskar is not available any more!
I had brought this up in last meeting with niranjan and decison was taken the increase the timing of water supply from 2 HR’s to 3 HR’s every day.
1/13/19, 11:30 AM - +91 98805 00667: However not sure if that decison is consistently followed
1/13/19, 11:34 AM - JRBabuDanny: One suggestion. Please check for water leakage especially in commodes.
1/13/19, 11:36 AM - +91 98863 96197: Yes , last time I faced the issue , it was due to a leakage in one of the toilets , due to particles in the water sometimes the flush regulator gets jammed leading to leakage
1/13/19, 11:39 AM - +91 98805 00667: These are the first things checked! There is a obvious water pressure problem in some houses which is very visible! The presssue tends to becomes ok after 1-1.5hrs water is opened
1/13/19, 11:43 AM - +91 98805 00667: BTW, I have not hit the issue since the water release timing was increased 2 weeks back. Typically, I used go get into this issue every 10-15 days!
1/13/19, 11:58 AM - +91 99021 72172: We faced this issue sometime back due to 
- Clogged pipes
- not fully opened terrace valves

1/13/19, 6:58 PM - +91 98863 56584: I checked all the possibilities for leakage as well as block in water filter. The issue is with inflow. The sump is filled now with tanker water. If the inflow from our supply is good,  the filled tank should stay. Otherwise the tank will become empty in another 15 odd days.
1/13/19, 9:59 PM - JR18Jayakumar: I understood that water is not flowing with right pressure.. i hope water meeting is functional. If possible Can you measure the water meter reading couple of days and compare with couple of neighborhoods where they have no issues..  if not for the whole day just for an hour during the water distribution. That gives some clue where the problem is.
1/13/19, 10:32 PM - +91 98863 56584: Thanks for the hint. Will try that.
1/14/19, 8:12 AM - +91 99004 39355: Thanks for your presence and making our princess birthday memorable to us. We hope you all enjoyed it.

1/14/19, 8:32 AM - JR18Jayakumar: That was wonderful party and gathering; Thank you for hosting the same; May God bless you and your family;
1/14/19, 8:35 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Anupam... In the recent past similar slow water flowing was addressed by watering reversely to the in-let of sump with little pressure; that removed the clogging; I'm sure you would have done that; if not give a try.
1/14/19, 8:36 AM - +91 90196 85428: It was a wonderful party. We all enjoyed it. Lots of blessing and love for Aashka

1/14/19, 9:52 AM - +91 98805 00667: How did you do that - we haven’t tried that yet
1/14/19, 10:51 AM - JR18Jayakumar: just take a normal tube, route the water from tap to the in-let of sump and let it flow for 30 seconds to 1 minute to push any debris.
1/14/19, 3:01 PM - +91 97405 83964: Anybody has a old car Tyre tube or cycle Tyre tube? Only tube is needed. Totally useless one is also fine.

12/11/19, 5:10 PM - YogaSayee: I just signed up JR Greenwich for Farmizen Tribes. They deliver organic veggies twice a week to communities. We need 19 more registrations before a Farmizen Tribe gets activated for JR Greenwich. Go sign up now at https://tribe.farmizen.com/tribe/waitlist?community_name=JR_Greenwich
12/11/19, 5:10 PM - YogaSayee: Dear all, Farmizen has launched a new model called Farmizen Tribes in which you do not need to subscribe and can buy organic vegetables as you choose. And they will deliver twice a week. But we need at least 20 signups from JR Greenwich before they start it here
12/11/19, 5:10 PM - YogaSayee: Quality and feedback is outstanding so far
12/11/19, 5:20 PM - +91 97418 32223: Saee - is tribes different than renting a farm. I didn't have a good experience after renting farm. These guys kept on delivering veggies which i struggled to use. And it was unfortunate that they didn't take corrective steps to address the issue.
12/11/19, 5:45 PM - YogaSayee: Yes kunal, its a different model..
You dont have to rent a farm..they source organic veggies from different trusted farms, including their farms and home deliver according to the order
12/11/19, 5:46 PM - YogaSayee: Impressed with the packing and vegetables fresheness..  Recieved first delivery 👍👍

India is polluted with pesticides throughout without exception. so better have it. u can adjust Ro fiter to bring it TDS levels to say only 350 instead of 100 if u wish ur self. this also increases life of RO and saves u costly replacement every 12-18 months

1/3/20, 8:23 AM - +91 99808 47825: Just experienced, someone stole the happy milk packet from Villa 23. Of course while we need to have camera to track, it is becoming increasingly easy for folks to try something like this. Is there something that can be done at security end to ensure they think twice. Do not think there is enough physical checking by security after folks exit.
1/3/20, 12:23 PM - Jr8Veena: Well sambit it is a milk packet which need not be evident for checking thru security.
whoever does it might drink it and throw the packet in the bin.
Saying this thru our experience in our community. Our milk packet would go missing often and so was many others packets too.but later came to know that it was a night duty electrician's job.
Best way is to install hidden camera if the incident repeats.
1/3/20, 12:26 PM - +91 99808 47825: Yeah agreed. I am not after milk packet 😄. But came to know it has happened with many earlier. So the concern is larger so that if someone does it, how we can push them back as it can be anything that can be lost. Thanks for your response.
1/3/20, 12:32 PM - +91 97318 77400: Any other diagnostic centers nearby?  addon and sunny are not available today.

1/3/20, 12:36 PM - Jr8Veena: Nahin sambit u didn't get me...
I meant that since it is milk packet the thief will use it probably before leaving the premises.so it might not be evident during security chk

1/8/20, 9:12 PM - JRVenu: Folks… we as we get closer to Sankranti, wanted to tell you more about this festival.
*Sankranti Fun Fact # 1*: Makar Sankranti is THE ONLY festival in India that follows the solar calendar. This is the reason why it falls around the same dates of the year after year as per Gregorian calendar.
1/8/20, 10:04 PM - +91 94484 67820: 👍
1/9/20, 7:07 AM - +91 97312 07112: Good piece of information! 👍
1/9/20, 7:24 AM - JRVenu: Hi Friends… please let us know how many people (adults vs kids) that will be attending from each of your respective villas by updating the sheet (link below)

1/9/20, 11:28 AM - +91 70266 17733: Thank you Anupam
1/9/20, 8:32 PM - JRVenu: *Fun Fact #2* Hindus believe that winter brings sickness and infections and basking in the early morning sun on the day of Makar Sankranti will help them to get rid of variety of harmful bacteria that live on their bodies. Kite-flying is a mode of making this sun basking a little more interesting and fun.
1/10/20, 6:40 AM - +91 99808 47825: Hi Security subcommittee,  wish to raise an issue. After I raised my issue last time, this is 6th time today the milk packet delivered is crushed in front of my door. The guy delivers at 5am and someone intentionally takes it out from a zipped bag and crush it. I am suspecting another daily vendor doing it out of competitive mindset. I went to security to check who all have come in from 5am to 6am. They cannot show a consolidated view as they say it does not exist in MyGate App. It can only capture by villa no who are checked out. No thief will come against the villa where he wants to do mess. Appreciate if My Gate guys can be explored to present a view or who has access to show the view.
1/10/20, 6:48 AM - +91 99808 47825: Just to add, after they crush, they zip the bag too. So cat cannot do 😊
1/10/20, 6:51 AM - +91 98809 06432: Since you have ruled out the cat, nothing much to offer. But in my case, I had seen cat taking milk out of box which had it's lid rightly and tightly put
1/10/20, 6:51 AM - JrSashidhar: 😆😆 on a lighter note , you seem to have enemy at different level.
1/10/20, 6:51 AM - +91 99808 47825: Hahaha, agreed 😝
1/10/20, 6:53 AM - JrSashidhar: A smart cat 😬
1/10/20, 6:54 AM - Bhagavan: One more lighter note:  what about handing over keys to vendor? So that he safely keep it inside 🧐
1/10/20, 6:55 AM - Bhagavan: Cat can't unlock it
1/10/20, 6:56 AM - +91 99808 47825: Yeah work around now is, I am telling the guy to deliver with security. But I guess I was after, we should have capability to know who all are entering n checking out at a community level not at a villa level. I am sure that view should exist with access control.
1/10/20, 7:12 AM - +91 96566 20522: May not be the best solution for you but here is a multi-purpose WiFi based camera that may be helpful - https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07HJD1KH4/
I am using it in my home (not in JRG).
1/10/20, 7:22 AM - +91 99808 47825: Thank you..yeah that's what we all are after 👍
1/10/20, 7:28 AM - +91 96566 20522: I really like that cam. You can place it outside the door. All it needs is power and WiFi. You can speak to the person standing outside from phone (2-way), if needed. Rotate the angle using the App on phone. Only disadvantage is I see so far is, storage is within the camera and if someone steals the camera, the recorded data is gone (unless you record it on the phone itself).
1/10/20, 9:49 AM - +91 99808 47825: Truck rammed into divider in front of ecospace. Going to be horrible traffic at Orr today.

1/12/20, 1:40 PM - JRVenu: Folks... want to avoid any miscalculations of the food volume and events... so request anyone that is yet to register to take the time to add your names/numbers to the sheet below... would like to get the final number by today.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/110jVDhLUv_kFV0wr5G3J7Mu9vMf3aP_eHVzVICaEQA4/edit#gid=0
1/12/20, 4:27 PM - +91 98864 44618: Is airtel down?
1/12/20, 4:29 PM - +91 77953 59366: Any reference to car cleaner pls

Hi, Due to technical issues you may experience disruption on your Airtel Xstream Fiber/Fixedline services. The expected time to resume your services is 12-JAN-2020 20:00:00. Inconvenience caused is regretted.
1/12/20, 4:42 PM - +91 96504 56611: Haha

1/13/20, 10:11 AM - Jr8Veena: Corporate hospitals are paying a salary of *Rs. 3-4 lakhs per month or more to their doctors.

But they have monthly targets.
The target condition for them to remain in job is that *they have to prescribe tests & scans worth *Rs. 5 lakh* & *trap at least 25 patients* for surgery every month.

This does not happen in *charity hospitals.*

In many hospitals, unwanted surgeries & risky premature cataract surgeries are being carried out. One has to be fearful of corporate hospitals.

Never show your medical Insurance card or say *"Doctor, don't bother about expense, please save me"*

*If they terrify you & do not give you time to think, then you must leave and not get treated there.*

If they advise a surgery or a medical procedure, then. Take time & call at *70266 46022* or send your medical reports at *medical@medisense.me* or else visit  *medisensehealth.com* They will get you a second opinion from a panel of expert doctors. It is a free service for patients in India.

This free service for patients is available in *21 cities in India* which includes *Udupi, Mangalore, Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad*, etc.

*Please pass on this information to all your loved ones.*
1/13/20, 11:26 AM - JRNiranjan: Medisense was founded by one Mr.Shashidhar Pai (Mangalore), whom I met with in Goa last year. Humble person with honest intent 🙂 !

The residential program is offered as week-long modules, though an immersion of 2-3 weeks is recommended. 2-week Early Explorer immersions cover both STEM and Humanities content, while multi-week Explorer immersions give an opportunity to learn exciting contemporary topics like strategic thinking through board games, communication and writing, neuroscience and cognition, the science of cooking, wobblebots and engineering design and more! 

Passionate learners and gifted children from schools around the country including DAIS, Bombay Scottish, TISB, Vidyashilp, Inventure Academy, PSBB etc., have attended past programs and have been extremely satisfied. 

Students at the end of Grade 5 or Grade 6 can register for the Early Explorer program, while those at the end of Grade 7, 8 or 9 can register for the Explorer program. 

The fee for 1 week is Rs. 39,000 (and Rs. 35,000 for additional weeks).

The first edition of the Summer 2020 programs runs from Apr 19- May 31, and the second edition from Jun 14- Jul 25. The programs will be hosted at the green and verdant campus of ECC, Bengaluru. Please call Rajesh on 9840970514 or Vishnu on 9342247734 to know more, or visit the links below.

1/29/20, 5:56 PM - +91 98809 06432: Does it mean that different people deliver the milk via fth, supr and doodhwala? Or Somasekhar delivers for all the apps?
1/29/20, 6:51 PM - JRHimanshu: Different people.
1/29/20, 6:51 PM - +91 95351 88288: What is FTH
1/29/20, 6:52 PM - +91 70226 67948: Fresh to home
1/29/20, 7:01 PM - +91 97405 83964: My take as i have tried two of the apps so far:
1. FTH Daily (Fresh to Home) -> Initial months you get lot of cashbacks. No delivery charges for milk. Delivery is quite early in the morning (mostly by 6am). Very nice User interface
2. BB daily : Initial 20 days free milk of 500ml. No delivery charges for milk. Lot of issues with the delivery of veg/bread/paneer kind of items. But milk supply, no major issues. User interface is bit tricky.
3. Supr -> Not yet tried. This is owned by Swiggy. So it could be good.
4. Daily Ninja -> Before 1 year, all of us were on this. A lot of issues. Delivery of milk is chargeable. Also non milk items are painful. Also cutoff time to change the order is not till 9pm previous day.

This may help you guys in taking decision. :)
1/29/20, 8:03 PM - JRHimanshu: *FTH* was *doodwala* before.

Based on the discussions and updates we have given to you regarding the security agency, we have worked with a couple of volunteers who identified, reviewed and finalized a new security vendor.  After the approval from the MC, we have closed the contract with one of the security agencies.
The vendor is Gorkha Security Agency, and they have commenced services from today morning.  They are closely working with Jayaram as part of the onboarding process and should be completing the ramp-up in the next few days.
We would like to request all of your support and cooperation as part of the transition phase (a few days).  Please work with Jayaram on any issues and he will do the needful.
Please reach out to Gopal, Vinay, or myself (Venu) on any questions.
Thank you all…

2/9/20, 1:56 PM - +91 99808 47825: Hi Electrical subcommittee, wish to know scope of Abhijeet. Is he supposed to address villa specific electrical issues or only common area ?
2/9/20, 2:07 PM - JRSatish34: Submit a request in mygate and Jayaram will look into it accordingly
2/9/20, 2:08 PM - +91 99808 47825: I have requested. Abhijeet came and looked at it. Suggested to call Shankar as  it will take time to troubleshoot where is the short circuit.
2/9/20, 2:09 PM - JRSatish34: Okay, then it might be related to the JR electrical wiring
2/9/20, 2:11 PM - +91 99808 47825: Ok so that is not part of Abhijeet's scope. If Shankar will not be available tomorrow, is JR responsible to take accountability..
2/9/20, 2:12 PM - +91 99808 47825: Just to be aware so that we know who is accountable or it is villa owner only ?
2/9/20, 2:16 PM - JRSatish34: Is it that the problem with jr wiring or something else.. that is not clear. Nevertheless, resident electrician priority is to attend common area maintenance and then individual villas on case by case basis.
2/9/20, 2:18 PM - +91 99808 47825: Looks like scope is fluid so far. It might be great to define the agreed scope as it seems it is left to him now to decide what he wants to attend in a villa. Thanks Satish.
2/9/20, 2:20 PM - JRSatish34: Disagree. Scope is well defined and understood. If it's to do with cctv, cove lighting etc which are time consuming to troubleshoot and fix then the priority is to attend other critical calls. In such cases it's better to reach out to the electrician who has initially done that work.
2/9/20, 2:25 PM - +91 99808 47825: The specific case is, the MCB is going off and short circuit is there. So for troubleshooting, someone has to find what is creating the short circuit. Today we might beg and borrow Shankar, but that is not a permanent solution as he does not have any binding to attend. Also Shankar had not done original wiring but some Bhaskar did originally. So I would have expected our resident Electrician to own. It is fine , it rests with villa owner as the priority for him cannot be defined by the villa owner.
2/9/20, 2:35 PM - JRSatish34: I am told it's been diagnosed to a likely issue above ur false ceiling. So it's better to have a second opinion before you have to cut through your false ceiling 😊
2/9/20, 2:38 PM - +91 99808 47825: Hahaha, it is a guess for now  without facts 😄 so anyway have more confidence with Shankar. I was just asking for a standard protocol. Thanks for checking 👍

2/10/20, 6:08 PM - Jr8Veena: Dear Parents,

Congratulations !

Your child is appearing for his/her boards ...

Its indeed a proud moment that your child has excelled beautifully in his/her journey till STD 9th/ STD 10th / STD 12th

But dear parents, now that they are starting with their exams, next 20 days is going to be crucial from them as well as you too.
Lot of mood swings, sadness, enthusiasm, relaxed behavior,  rudeness etc can be expected from the children.
And it's ok since lot of unnecessary stress has been built up by our education system , when it comes to Board Exams.

Let's support our children.

How you can do that?

Some simple tips which can be implemented from your end, to help your child cope up with the stress.

1 Please wake them up in the morning with a positive stroke, a touch/ hug  which a child expects from his parents.

2 Start your child's day with a positive statement - I love you,come let's start this beautiful day together etc

3 Take care about the communication you have with your child, before s/he leaves for his exams. I am sure you will excel, I am sure you will give your best, all luck to you, I will be waiting for you to come back sweetheart....etc

4  Do not let your anxiety pass on to your child. Whatever the situation is, last moment positive support from your end will give a boost to your child's confidence

5 When the child comes back, please avoid asking only how was the exam, instead ask....how was the experience....
Let's unwind for the day, let's go out for sometime / let's have a cup of coffee together etc

Avoid talking about the subject.

Gone is gone...you can't alter that but atleast you can support the child for the coming one.

6 Please ensure that a very happy and healthy atmosphere is given to the child in the house during his exams.

Avoid unnecessary arguments within the family, differences can be solved later; 
Don't forget- that will affect your child and that will add to his stress

7 Please play soft instrumental music while the child is having his breakfast or relaxing with you

8 Avoid giving marks target to the child.He is sensible enough to understand his targets

9 Keep fresh flowers in the house, that brings lots of positivity in the house

10 Avoid nagging for any reasons

11 With a positive stroke, make the child sleep..your two minutes will give him sound sleep for some hours, that will help the child to combat with the situation

12 Avoid advice pls, give the child his space 

13 Stand by your child even if the exam has not gone as per your or his expectations..It's ok...

14 Most important: 
From today, don't let the child meet the relatives or friends, last moment negative statements or expectations might prove detrimental for the child.

Lots of love to your child and 
Yes - you please be calm, be patient and all luck to you too , my dear parents. 
Feel free to share
2/10/20, 9:49 PM - Jr8Veena: Just got a approval call from mygate from a guy from a medical shop.
Inspite of declining the permission...i got a msg that he went in .
When I called the visitor thru true caller..he said that he had got medicines for villa number 202 .
When I asked him to give the phone to the security he said that he was already out and away.
I have called him in a matter of a few minutes.
I then called the security guy.he has no clue about it.
Though i don't live there...iam just sharing this incident hoping that it might help u ppl as a concern for security reasons.
2/10/20, 10:13 PM - +91 99450 27635: Yes the  medicine’s were delivered to 202, and I received and approved the notification. The person was visiting 2 other Villas as well so probably there was an error in entering the Villa Number.
2/10/20, 10:17 PM - +91 94483 82400: Even I got the approval request from myGate but that was valid one as I had medicines to be delivered.
2/10/20, 10:52 PM - +91 73492 85430 changed to +91 96861 11715
2/11/20, 12:29 AM - Jr8Veena: Ok...thanks for the clarification.
My villa number might have been a wrong entry.
2/11/20, 6:37 AM - +91 99808 47825: However you are right that, security ( new one in place now) first let them in and then the approval request in MyGate comes in when they land in house for some of the cases. Might be a learning curve issue.
2/11/20, 9:07 AM - Jr8Veena: Thats a major issue.this shud not be let to repeat since it is a major lapse in the security's functioning aspect.u ppl must discuss it with the concerned person about it.
2/11/20, 9:56 AM - JRVenu: I understand there is a mistake done by security folks.  I would not call it a major lapse and create panic.  Having said that... it would great to have people join the security committee and solve the issues rather than just point fingers and keep complaining.  The few volunteers that are involved are working hard to ensure the new agency is on board.  We should shop pulling people down... but rather be part of the team to solve it.
2/11/20, 10:24 AM - +91 99808 47825: Hi Venu, just a proposal so that someone who is not able to contribute much here , does not feel guilty of bringing up issues here or someone does not feel loaded with too much coz they are handling the subcommittees, I propose that we can look at a professional third party to manage the facility as the next level of maturity here in our journey.
2/11/20, 10:29 AM - JRVenu: Sambit... I have no problem with people raising issues.  These are issues that all of us want resolved.  I am keen not to press the panic button to quick.  And solutions are always important.  The fact that you said it is a learning curve shows that you are considerate... I have a no problem with that.  But having said that... volunteers is always something that we need.
2/11/20, 10:31 AM - +91 81975 49058 left
2/11/20, 10:32 AM - +91 99808 47825: Agreed however my proposal for a third party is to address that as well coz if we raise an issue with electrical stuff, I would not look for Satish 😊 to respond. Just looking for some consistent process so that we all can be at same level of contribution. Third party at the right cost, might be an answer. Would look at MC to review to evaluate this proposal. Thank you.
2/11/20, 10:34 AM - JRVenu: Third party estate management company will be 2x to 3x the cost. Are we ok with that?
2/11/20, 10:35 AM - JRVenu: BTW... We did look into that already
2/11/20, 10:36 AM - +91 99808 47825: It would be great to know those facts if some quotes we already have, who knows it might work out with all. Finally we vote and agree/ disagree.
2/11/20, 10:39 AM - JRVenu: We did talk about it in the first AGM. Anyway... I do not want to make it emotional. It is something that we can talk when we meet next
2/11/20, 10:40 AM - +91 99808 47825: Thank you 😊

2/11/20, 9:23 PM - Jr8Veena: <Media omitted>
2/12/20, 12:09 PM - JrGopal128Wood: This was investigated & here are the results :
1. One of the  2 deliveries done by Balaji Medicals had a capsule of 8mg which got written on top of the delivery cover as  "medicine name suffix 8" and the number 8  was  in big font & encircled... Upon seing the cover the guard  entered 8 assuming that to be the Villa number. By the time he realised the mistake, the notification had gone to Veena which she declined and the matter ended there. So, Veena - you know how you got this request.... 
As a corrective action, Venkat at Balaji Medicals has been provided with necessary guidelines.  Also Jayaram  had discussions with the security staff to get the right info before they input entries in Mygate. Still, if any of you get a notification by mistake, please note that the app has the Deny/Reject button to exercise.

2. In discussion with the new guards and based on his / Abhijit's surprise checks, Jayaram confirms that a delivery guy to JRG is not permitted to move  inside until all entries are complete and an answer in terms of "Approve" or "Reject" is got from all whenever he comes with deliveries scheduled for multiple Villas.
Hope this answers any concerns arising out of few messages back & forth on this topic....still, if anyone has questions, do write to jrg.estatemanager@gmail.com with a copy to jrgassociation@gmail.com rather than this larger group. Thanks.

Last year, many of us contributed to Rainwater Recharge by deepening our  RWH wells. We would like others who could not do last year to contribute this year to rain water Recharge and RWH in your individual homes. Those interested please ping me and if many folks come forward I can help co ordinate the activity with relevant vendors.

 *Please Note: As per MC recommendation, avoid sump cleaning, water softner recharge until the monsoons start.*

3/6/20, 7:53 AM - +91 97418 32223: *Imp update about Holi 2020* - A week ago we sent the message announcing Holi celebration on Mar-13/Mar-14. Since then, there has been development with respect to potential cases and spread of COVID-19 virus in Bangalore and in particular our vicinity. Almost everywhere people are taking preventive measures to avoid infection and we've also decided to call off the Holi celebration next week.
I know some of you would be disappointed and please accept our apologies.
We would still like to do a small event on evening of Mar-9, Monday (actual Holika day) to encourage our kids and ladies who started preparing for this event.
*Revised plan*:
1. No Holi celebration on Mar-13/14 by Subcom
2. Holika event on 9th evening (post 7.30pm)- small bonfire with cultural event in tennis court.

Subsequent to the decision today by the state Government as well as a GO by the Commissioner (copy attched), we are announcing the following restrictions till 21st March, 2020 :

1. Clubhouse to remain closed  & hence the Swimming Pool, Gym , party hall & the play courts would not be available for use.

2.Coaching classes - academic or sports conducted anywhere inside the layout  would stand cancelled  and so would be any summer camps. Hence please  inform the coaches / tutors about the same.

3. Any boookings done of the Clubhouse  Party Hall will stand cancelled during this period unless the same is deferred to a later date. 

4. Any resident who has returned from a Corona affected place should self quarantine and desist from coming in contact with the rest till the stipulated 14 days' of quarantine is complete.

5. Residents are advised to pass on necessary awareness including sanitising requirements to  the maids and drivers, if not done already.

6. Now that most of the children have no school, they tend to channelize their energy outdoors playing all the time.
Parents are requested to educate their children on the importance of added hygiene including  hand sanitation  as needed.

7. Employer permitting, the working residents may choose to work from home for the next few days. If you choose to go to office, please avoid public transport including taxis for the time being & till the next advisory from the authorities.

8. Please read the GO below which has instructions regarding public places.

The above are preventive measures &  we do not want any panic button pressed out of this message. Let us pray everything comes to a close uneventful soon.  Thanks & Stay safe. 

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

3/14/20, 11:17 PM - JRVinay: Dear residents,

Thank you for your cooperation and help.  To further support prevention following are the add ons to earlier communication :

9. Delivery from Home delivery vendors like Bigbasket, Amazon pantry etc should  be taken a little away from the main door - could be in the Villa car park area. Allowing them inside the  Villa should be avoided till further notice.

10. Regular couriers/parcels from Amazon, Flipkart etc should be terminated at the Main gate security. Once you get a Mygate notification, please press "leave at security" option. Make sure you personally go and collect it from security by the end of the day.

11. Main gate security has been asked to do a visual check of the people entering the layout and in case of any suspicion, call & inform the villa owner.

Also sharing some additional documents having information for individual and community, received from various channels. Though some of you might have seen these already, in case not, then would request going through these.

Regards,

To support our government's efforts in preventing the spread of   CoVid-19,  it is our responsibility too  to do our part as responsible citizens and members of the community to control the spread of the virus.  In the interest of the community, we would like to request each of you to let the association (via email jrgassociation@gmail.com) know if  any of your family member/s has travelled to/from international locations or  affected places outside of Bangalore and returned to JR Greenwich in the past 10-14 days.  Should there be such cases, as already communicated, the onus of ensuring compliance to  quarantine guidelines lies with the concerned owner & please drop a note in this regard as to what has been done to ensure compliance.

Please do this  in the interest of your neighbors and the community… and for the good of the nation.
Thank you all for your support and cooperation.

Just one suggestion if it can be implemented.

Can we put few alcohol based sanitizer at the main security gate, phase 2 security gate and few other places? 

One dedicated sanitizer could be for the visitor and our visiting workers. 

For our internal dedicated staff, at few key places, we would need to keep soaps and sanitizers. 


If already implemented, pls ignore.

3/17/20, 9:52 AM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Yes
3/17/20, 10:07 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Good morning residents,
👇 is a message from a practicing doctor to her community members which is loud and clear given the current environment. Keeping in mind the well being of the community, we are advising immediate stoppage of all activities involving groups that take place at the park ( group play / group walk /chat etc) or even on the roads inside our layout. BBMP commissioner too has come out with a circular to this effect (attached).

We have also got some reports that a Maid's family around HSR is under quarantine on a suspected infection & hence 7 units in an apartment where the maid worked have been reported to the Health Authorities. While we are discussing any measures that needs to be taken  in terms of restrictions for maids, cooks,  car wash guys et al , please immediately review :
1. Where does the maid/cook stay  ( specifically take note if the maid/cook is staying in a crowded tented place where the chances of community exposure is high) 
2. Which all apartments they visit outside of our layout  ?
3. Do they know the precautionery steps to be taken in terms of hygiene and sanitisation ? If not train them again & again.
4. Before starting work in a villa, do they  thoroughly wash their hands as prescribed ?

The situation demands we all stay alert to what is going on around and support the authorities in general and the hospital staff in particular in their efforts to contain / prevent the spread. Each of us play an important role in keeping our immediate family, neighbourhood & the society at large healthy & safe. Let's join & do our might. 

Regards,
MC,  JRGSHOA
3/17/20, 10:09 AM - JrGopal128Wood: *Message from a Doctor from Bangalore :

Despite all the requests and warnings , We continue to see our people from (apartment name) gather around during the evenings and make the most of their “stay at home “ situation. Kids continue to play in groups while parents are taking a break. 

Please understand it’s very important to restrict movements currently , including morning and evening walks . And it’s very important to stay indoors and not in play areas or lawns 

Many doctors including myself are working with sick people daily and are seeing how people are succumbing to illnesses very quickly during these times. I have seen many of my own colleagues being quarantined because they have treated patients suspected with COVID -19. One of the doctors hasn’t seen her 3 year old toddler for nearly 4 days now. 

Medical personnel who are treating these patients are working like soldiers putting their own lives and families at risk . It’s a shame that the rest of the community is ignoring the health hazard and having cricket matches in the lawn and late evening chat parties. 

COVID 19 is no longer a problem that’s only in present some other part of the world . It’s here now , amongst us and spreading quickly . 

Please stay away from each other as much as possible. We can not afford any body being sick in our neighbourhood . The reason being that we have a large number of children and elderly people . Even moderately affected people may end up requiring ICU beds and we don’t have many in this area or in the city itself. Imagine not being able to find a suitable hospital bed with a sick child or an elderly parent.


The reason for all the worry about COVID is that even if 10 people in a group of 100 get affected and they keep moving around , they can infect the rest of the healthy 90 people in a matter of hours. Even if 10 of those hundred get very sick , we will run out of ICU beds in our vicinity . 

One doesn’t have to be symptomatic to infect others , about 40-50% of the affected people are asymptomatic. 

So please stop assuming that you are a super human and it won’t affect you or your family . Please be responsible citizens and make it worth while for the medical personnel to fight against this pandemic disease , who are putting ourselves and our families at higher risks .........and no doctors /nurses can’t work from home . 

We will continue to fight for the community no matter what but please don’t make us feel like idiots by being irresponsible citizens and continue to ignore the messages to do social distancing 🙏🏻

Regarding : Discussion around Covid 19 Suspect

Dear Residents

Today security was informed by one of the maids working in ahad euphoria and few residents reached out to EC regarding one of the residents with travel history to USA and having symptoms of being sick with cough.

We have reached out to the concerned residents who has mentioned that there are no covid symptoms to the person. From safety perspective the family has self quarantined themselves in the home. However going by the safety guidelines and following the protocol we have advised them to call up 104 helpline number and inform the authorities.

All Wing lift is cleansed with cleansing liquid.

Residents are required to not venture out of the house untill and unless extremely important and even in that case please take precautions. This will be observed till we get a clear signal from the authorities. Please note this situation should in no way target the individual or any group.
We request residents to not believe in rumor's.

It has been reported by helpdesk that residents are calling helpdesk for information/report regarding this case. At this point of time there is no positive case in Ahad euphoria. We request to be careful and not create panic.We expect cooperation from residents during this exercise.

We will wait for authorities confirmation.

Regards

EC

Corona Virus precautions for house-holds:

1. Wash milk bags the moment we take it & wash your hands while you are at it.

2. Consider cancelling newspapers.

3. Keep a separate tray for couriers. Courier person can place the envelope/pkg in the tray and courier may be left untouched for at least 24 hours. 

4. Instruct maids not to touch main door. On entering the home, she has to immediatly wash hands thoroughly, before touching other things . After that, wipe the calling-bell switch with a cleaning fluid :)

3. Avoid getting swiggy, amazon etc as far as possible.

4. Wash all fruits and vegitables once we bring them home.

5. Remote, phone and keyboards are the most highly contaminated elements in our house. Clean them at least once a day using cleaning fluid.

6. Wash hands frequently when in house or in office. Once every hour at least.

7. Avoid public transport as far as possible. Even Ola and Uber may be used when absolutely unavoidable.

8. Avoid gyms, swimming pool and other exercise areas, where surface contact or air-borne contamination is inevitable.

9. Cancel tuitions, dance/music classes, etc.

10. When you return home from office, shopping, etc. discard your clothes and wash your hands and feet thoroughly.

11. Most importantly do not touch hands anywhere on face. Inform children and parents.

12. Ask senior citizens to stop going for the routine walking exercise. 

Lets all be alert as we will enter stage 3 soon which is an outbreak of infection in community (from individual cases)

May be I am sounding a little over cautious but still wanted to share
3/19/20, 1:55 PM - JRVinay: Dear Residents,

This is in continuation of our earlier communications  regarding the measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. MC members had a meeting today to discuss about the compliance to our previous advisories as well as added measures keeping in mind the changes since the last communication. The gist of the discussions and decisions are :

1. Social distancing : this is the need of the hour and has been highlighted in our previous communication.  MC has observed that the activities in groups  by Children , adults & senior citizens  including walking in groups & chatting, playing on large groups etc continues. For now we would request additional caution to be exercised at individual level and maintain adequate distance in interactions (at least ~6 feet as per guideline from various sources).  In case of additional restrictions needed, and social distance becoming a mandate, entry to the main park might need to be blocked which we want to avoid. Please follow & advise your children / parents too.

2. Maids/Cooks/Drivers : Our previous communication had an expectation from individual owners to ascertain from these helps about their place of stay, mode of commuting, work details outside of JRG just from a risk assessment perspective. Just by observation and discussion with the maids entering, our security confirms that there are some maids / cooks who are common to Ahad and  JRG. Please review and do the needful at your end.

*3. Self quarantine : Residents who have gone into self quarantining are not to come out and socialise at any cost till the prescribed quarantine period is over. The scope of this requirement is extended to those who travelled to & from affected areas in India (in addition to overseas travel earlier).*

To do our part in preventing the spread and keep our community safe, till further notice, the *MC has considered additional measures below* to further limit exposure from outside entries : 

1) Stopping enty of newspaper delivery personnel - from tomorrow.

2) Stopping entry of car wash/cleaning personnel - from tomorrow

3) All the deliveries at main gate only except groceries and milk. To reduce the exposure to our security staff, please postpone non critical  orders/services for sometime. *Also please take precautions while handling deliveries and if possible sanitize before use*.

4) Individual Villa owner to review the process to address the potential risk in getting maids/cooks who work outside of JRG and *educate them for taking precautions outside and inside of our community*.

5) Construction workers come and go out straight to their work site, not to interact  with other staff, if situation demands then their entry will be stopped completely.

6) All workers & delivery guys (Grocery & Milk) to wash hands at the main gate prior to getting in. Provision for the same is being made today.

These are difficult measures which will cause inconvenience to all of us including our helps/vendors/support system. But are needed to support the prevention efforts and will be applicable from tomorrow. As and when the situation permits to relax these, the same will be communicated in writing. Request your much required cooperation and also to inform service providers for same.

*Also request you to consider conveying to service providers that this change is temporary and their payments will be made (paid time off). This is based on suggestions received for individuals to consider on humanitarian ground. This money guarantee will also help boost their morale and get  back to work once the situation improves and permits their entry so any additional support to service providers in this time will be highly appreciated.*

*_The MC earnestly requests the residents not to send back a rejoinder/response into this advisory. Any specific genuine concerns may please be directed to our association mail id : jrgassociation@gmail.com_*

Thanks for your attention & co-operation. Stay safe and wishing all the best of health.

Regards,
Management Committee

3/19/20, 2:03 PM - JrDrSathishLanlord: I learnt the following after being in a lock down since last week:


1. Why the bathrooms and toilets were *outside* our houses and not *inside*.

2. Why we should not touch anything or anybody when we return from a barbershop or a funeral. You may return to normalcy *only* after having a bath immediately.

3. Why the footwear has to be kept outside the house and not inside.

4. Why we have to wash our hands and feet when we returned from schools or outside after playing. 

5. Why a mandatory 10 days isolation / quarantine (especially at a birth or death) in traditional households.

6. Why the households must not cook if there's a dead body inside the house.
 
7. Why the washing of discarded clothes has to be done outside the house and not inside.

8. Why was it mandatory to be clean and have bath before cooking for the house.

9. Why once you have had bath, you were not supposed to physically touch those who did not.


Maintaining physical hygiene, social distance and cleanliness were laughed at, ridiculed, insulted, systematically breaking these traditions brick by brick, forcing people to discard these rituals for the fear of being isolated and *force fit* into a society blindly aping the Western way of life.  Now, all these habits &  routines  followed by Hindus from time immemorial stand validated.👍
3/19/20, 2:51 PM - JRBirendraNetApp: 👍🏻👍🏻
3/19/20, 9:12 PM - JRVinay: Vis-a-vis the message sent this afternoon, we have informed the news paper vendor not to supply them from Saturday & till we get back to him. 

*Unlike the newspaper vendor who is a sole supplier, the other concerned service providers are many in numbers and here we are seeking the respective service takers/owners to inform and take  necessary actions.*

*As mentioned  earlier,  entries will be restricted from tomorrow along with other implementations.*

*Social distancing has been one of the major points in all of our communications on Covid prevention. The violations to this rule  still continues as of this evening - the third day in running.*

If it could help make it more clearer on its urgent need,  please read a write up below👇 from Italy by one of the citizens who repents for not having  been fore warned by the authorities  and how people's (crazy) behaviour contributed to a higher number of infections. The just concluded PM's address stresses heavily on social distancing & here we have the advise from the highest authority of the nation. *Can we all support on this _"without any compromise"_ along with other current measures (or as come in future) and also helping our support providers  in all possible ways?*

As carona virus life at one place is 12 hrs and curfew is for 14 hrs so the places  or points of public areas where  carona may live will not be touched for 14 hrs will break the chain. With lesser movement during the previous and post curfew nights, the effect could be much bigger than imagined. 

*Key is discipline!*
*No means NO movement outside your home.*

As carona virus life at one place is 12 hrs and curfew is for 14 hrs, so the places  or points of public *areas where  carona may live will not be touched for 14 hrs ,this will break the chain* . 
What we get  after 14 hrs will be a safe country .
So its the Idea behind . *Or this might be a drill ,if needed longer in near future* ... 🙏🏻😊

*Trupti Rankhamb*
*Mumbai based Yoga fitness Guru*

*Why clapping or making noise using thali chammach it's not a gimic but an ancient Indian farming technique to limit virus spread in crops*

What PM is asking us to clap hand and make noise with thali chammach is an ancient Indian technique  of curtailing virus spread in farming. 

The sound vibrations created by the mass will destroy virus and limit its spread. 

Few years ago I have watched a video of an organic Indian farmer who was practicing and using this technique on his farm. 

Just now when I sat in meditation after seeing Trupti" s message.

Will see if I get the video to share during day.


*Everyone please keep this spread this*

*In support of our nation against pandemic COVID19*

3/21/20, 10:02 AM - +91 96202 12548: Something to think about: as we give paid time off to our helps, are they actually taking precaution and staying at home or are they using this as an opportunity to travel and socialize. I request all to spread awareness to our helps that social distancing and personal hygiene is key. Some of them sadly don't even know what's going on in the country. It might just be better to keep them busy with a routine rather than giving paid time off.
3/21/20, 10:06 AM - JrPrashanth47: We are in a critical stage of virus spreading. Not withstanding the difficulties, it’s time to seriously think of allowing maids inside while we stopped car cleaners, newspapers vendors etc. maids have deeper access inside houses and I’m not fully sure of their awareness. Let’s be serious here if we want to be serious.
3/21/20, 10:11 AM - +91 99451 46942: Some of the maids are already have gone to attend weddings and also temple visit, they are not quarentinig themselves. Which inturn causes more speed spread. For their well being as well we better keep them occupied with routine. Provided if they don't need to depend on public transport to work and not working in other communities.

3/21/20, 10:23 PM - JrGopal128Wood: *Dear Residents,*
In our collective efforts to prevent the spread of Covid19, please note :
1. *All couriers are being terminated at the main gate*. The security guard who collects the same has been provided with the necessary briefing as well as PPE like the gloves and mask. *To reduce the additional burden on security, we request your support by collecting the parcels the same day so that enough space is available for receipts the next day. Postponing non-urgent orders would be the most ideal support.* Residents' discretion is recommended in appropriate handling/ sanitization of these parcels as well as other door step deliveries like milk & groceries. 

2. We have got limited quantity of hand sanitizers & the security has been briefed when to use them in place of  washing hands using soap/liquid soap which is already in place.

3. Based on the latest updates available to us and with a view to limit possible exposure, *we would strongly urge each resident to postpone  any visits by friends & relatives starting tomorrow unless the same is needed on an emergency basis.*

4. Sometime back we had asked for intimation to the association about any resident who has travelled to & from any overseas location. Subsequently, we expanded its scope by adding travel to Indian cities that have  been witnessing increased number of infections on a daily basis. Thanks to those who have intimated  but we feel that a few   may have missed. *Please send in such travel particulars to jrgassociation@gmail.com with out fail to ensure transparency.* This intimation shall remain confidential.

5. Last but not the least, *as per our PM's call, let us remain strictly indoors  from 7 a.m. till 9 p.m. tomorrow.* To express our gratitude to all those out there on the Covid19 battlefront, *all residents of every villa in JRG are to   assemble in their  respective terraces at 4.55 p.m. tomorrow.* Clapping/sounds of other types which go out to cheer those selfless service personnel will follow at the stroke of 5 p.m. Thanks for your support.

*Regards,*
*Management Committee,*
*JRGSHOA*

We have allowed essentials like milk and other FTH products this morning...why is there a ban on essential groceries?
3/22/20, 9:17 AM - JrAditya: *Hi all,*

I met the newspaper delivery man today around 6:45am at the gate.

He did not know that he will not be let in.

He has left the newspapers of all the subscribers at the gate with a request that we collect from there.

Thanks in advance for picking up your copy.

3/22/20, 9:21 AM - JRSrini: I would prefer that to. Can we have him leave the copy at main gate?
3/22/20, 9:21 AM - +91 96202 12548: Last I checked the government for whom I voted and pay my taxes did not pass a rule to ban newspapers. So untill then I am not breaking any law in this country.
3/22/20, 9:24 AM - JRHimanshu: 😄😄😄
3/22/20, 9:59 AM - +91 96202 12548: Something to think about: Is it riskier to have your items delivered at your doorstep from the specific vendor you placed the order from or is it riskier to have it collected by one main gate guard who can cross contaminate your package with other packages coming from multiple delivery partners? The guard could become your super spreader of the community. Who is watching that he is taking adequate measures? Hence it is not a solution but just a trade off which can be argued both ways. What cannot be argued is the importance of social distancing and personal hygiene. When you touch anything that was not under your supervision, please don't touch your face or eat anything before you wash your hands.
3/22/20, 10:50 AM - JRVenu: *Dear Residents,*

I agree we have to follow Govt guidelines and not get enthusiastic beyond reason. Some choices that are not community ones should be left alone. For eg we can appeal for people to clap at 5PM but if we start penalizing the ones who don't then we are going overboard.

But, not just in this occasion but also in previous instances too. Why do MC not welcoming feedback and inputs from outside the committee. What frustrates is that, MC makes decisions & rest must follow with no options to give their opinion. I think that’s unfair.
3/22/20, 11:25 AM - +91 96202 12548: I spoke to the paper guy and he has kindly agreed let me know when he is at main gate and I will collect my paper from him. And ofcourse I will be paying him as well!

3/22/20, 11:30 AM - +91 98801 52162: But dont mind collecting newspaper alone from maingate everyday. Or for that matter, not having newspaper but paying the vendor if it is too difficult for the vendor to manage such individual preferences

That's the sole reason to have MC. In emergency like this, quick action needs to be taken. Criticizing every action by them by some people, will only discourage them doing their job. Some decisions may go wrong, after all they are also human beings!

Agree that this is completely voluntary work done by MC hence completely appreciate all who are able to participate. I am also very satisfied with the quality of the functioning of JRG.

One thing is for sure.  Nobody is questioning the efficacy of process. Nobody is undermining the gravity of the situation. 

 New suggestions always lead to new process ideas. Sometimes we agree,  sometimes we don't.

3/22/20, 1:49 PM - JRVenu: Dear All,
Thank you for all the feedback.  Sometimes when we are making decisions at the pace of the CoVid-19 it is good to get input.  So, thank you all.
The discussion we are having is not about "Vs"… it is about making sure that we are keeping the best interest of the community.  In many cases we get the feedback from many of you… just not in a public forum/chat session.  Based on all the input we get, and hours of our own research and cross checks… we tend to make the decisions.  So please continue to give us feedback… and understand that DO NOT make decisions unilaterally or based on 1-2 people's views.
As residents… we are as much in pain as all, and just like all of you… we are needing to take a step back and sacrifice a few small things for the good of the community, and our country.
If nothing else… CoVid-19 has brought this community closer and made us all aware of us and our community more than before.
Thank you all for the support… and let's continue to work as a community.

3/22/20, 1:55 PM - +91 95351 88288: I agree with this... Since almost most of us have not stepped out of JR since 14days now... 

therefore all Daily essential requirements  like fruits and vegetables are being fulfilled by these vendors.. Moreover these vendors are entering main gate in a vehicle and directly drop parcels at our door step... They are NOT touching anything or anywhere... We can let the parcel lie in our parking and keep it isolated for 8 hrs..

The other scenario will be all the stuffs getting collected at main gate with chances of more n more touches getting mixed... Not every parcel (food items) will be collected immediately and there are chances of more chaos and infection..
Also more chances of exposing our main gate security to risk.
3/22/20, 1:55 PM - +91 95351 88288: 👍🏻
3/22/20, 2:00 PM - +91 97405 83964: For security guards and other working staff, since today is an off everywhere (not sure if our regular supplier is supplying them the tea or not), do we need to provide tea/coffee/biscuits from our houses?

If it is taken care already, pls ignore. 

I can provide some if needed.

3/22/20, 10:30 PM - JRVinay: *Dear Residents,*
 
Thanks for the support extended to the MC on all the efforts specific to Covid19 prevention. During the day today, many a questions were raised around some of the actions taken and we found it necessary to clarify to put to rest further discussions on them. 

*As was communicated earlier,  door delivery was permitted for daily essentials like Milk, Groceries, vegetables & fruits and there was no embargo placed this morning by the securiry. This process will continue.*

All other deliveries would be received at the main gate by the security. Request you to pick up by the end of the day.Please take care of handling precautions and sanitations beyond this.

*To reduce the burden as well as exposure to security, please cancel / postpone all orders of non critical items.* Depending on the prevailing situation, the MC may decide to stop receiving such orders at the gate with a day's notice.

Please note that our previous communications had few advisories & one of them was on the respective villa owner to get the complete background check of the helps hired by them and doing a risk assessment. Upon risk assessment, giving time off to such helps with pay was an advise on humanitarian grounds. Please note that the association can not foot such bills since our maintenance scope does not cover it nor the maintenance demanded periodically has such costs as a part of computations.

*Thanks to all the residents for supporting the Janta curfew and coming over to the terrace to clap & cheer all the personnel who are helping the infected to recover.*

Regards,
Management Committee

3/23/20, 9:14 AM - JRNiranjan: (Something that we all can try)

Msg from Sadhguru 👇. 

Let’s try to do for a day tomorrow and then see the difference 

“Whatever we are talking about is what we are perpetuating in our experience. The only way to keep any kind of illness or virus or flu away is to not talk about it and it will dissipate itself. 

What we do instead is keep checking the statistics or keep spreading the "awareness" messages on social media without noticing it that the more we talk about it the more it becomes active in our vibration. History is full of evidence of epidemics because of the mass consciousness created by fear of the disease. Fear is a very strong vibration and more fearful we are of any epidemic it becomes a reality very fast.. it's the law. The more you feed the energy of fear the more profound it becomes. 

Ignore the things you don't want to participate in. Stop discussing it with family and friends; stop checking out the latest statistics. Stop watching incessantly the news about Corona Virus. Take your attention away and It has no power on you. The creation of anything is to give thought to it by keeping it active in our vibration by being afraid of it. Hook yourself up with  ever flowing stream of well- being”.

Love and light to all.
Sadhguru

3/27/20, 12:49 PM - JRVinay: *Dear Residents,*
 
Appreciate your  support extended  on all the measures and efforts specific to Covid19 prevention. Following are some *additional  updates/information* post our previous communication...

1) Given the movement restrictions and to further reduce the risk from their  surroundings,  our electrician and security staff will be staying temporarily with in the layout which they have also requested. The STP operator has been given a letter to carry while commuting back & forth. The housekeeping staff who stay in the sheds nearby have been briefed the do's and don'ts both inside and outside the layout.   *We are looking to provide all possible support to our association staff including their safety, precautions, eatables etc and minimizing their outside exposure.*

2) Starting yesterday evening, we have *started spraying disinfectants* on our internal roads and other possible areas of exposure.

3) All of us have been managing successfully one of the most difficult measures i.e  keeping kids inside the house. Request to continue with the same and *not to let them group up with other kids.* 

4) Due to delivery issues with daily essentials, we understand  going out became a necessity. We hope deliveries to be getting better back  soon. Our request is to totally avoid or  if it is so really critical, minimise by clubbing such moves since *we  are onto the next phase of this pandemic and the outside exposure could prove too costly.* Appreciate the same already being done by fellow residents for the milk purchases last couple of days. *Anyone forced to take out a vehicle, once back,  please leave the vehicle under sunlight  away from the car porch of the Villa for a long duration. Please continue to sanitize and take precautions for all your deliveries, purchases getting into the house.*

5) Waste clearance & Fumigation services may get occassionally impacted in the coming days. We will try to manage with the available resources as much as we can. *Also hope you might be taking all the precautions handling/sanitizing garbage bins.*

6) *Avoiding spread,  individually and as a community,  is the motivation and aim of all these efforts.* Any one villa getting in the unfortunate grip of this disease may impact the well-being of the whole community. We appreciate alert residents highlighting to us violations to guidelines whenever the same was observed. Necessary action has been taken from our end and will continue to do so. Let's collectively avoid such actions calling for reminders / notices by following the requirements to the fullest and win this challenge as a team. 

*Once again thank you for your attention on the communications and cooperation in following all the measures.*

*STAY AT HOME & STAY SAFE!*

Regards,
Management Committee

As you know we have asked Abhijit to stay on the campus so that he does not have to encounter any issues coming to JRG during the lockdown period.  He has gracefully obliged to our request.

Since he is here away from all the utensils and other items… some of the members of the community have been asking if they can take care of his meal requirements.

If any of you are interested to pitch-in… please update the sheet (link given below) with the name of your villa in the Breakfast or Lunch or Dinner columns next to the dates given.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1080KAhqEZc8-SFLBp-HLiMKOWEMihQbwI1V2i6OywmY/edit?usp=sharing

Thank you all of kind gesture… it is great to see the community acts like a family.

PS: Please do call and let him know a little ahead of time so that he is aware that you are volunteering for that segment.

Regards…

3/31/20, 6:24 PM - JrGopal128Wood: *Dear Residents,*
Further to our last communication on Covid19 prevention measures, please note :
1. Inspite of our best efforts to retain *our housekeeping staff*,   all of them  *have gone back to their home town.* As a result, sweeping the streets / other common areas, pruning of park /lawn grass & shrubs, watering all common greens etc are impacted. In discussion with *Abhijit & Balareddy,* the least that we could workout  is *to water the common greens on non-water release days* which they will handle early in the morning and late in the afternoon. If you spot them near your Villa / street while they are on the job, *please be kind enough to ask if they want any help anywhere*. STP Basha too will pitch in  as much as he can side by side working on STP processing. 

2. While preserving the greens is our top priority, *we are not in a position to assign anyone to sweep & clear the falling from the trees or the dust.* That leaves us with the only option to clean as much as we can till the situation improves.

3. We have been notified by *Hasiru Dala* that :
(a) *all used masks ,gloves and tissues used to cover while sneezing/coughing or moving out should be  separately wrapped in a paper and red marked with a "X".*  The collection guy will come with a separate bag and the respective resident will need to personally dump it in the prescribed bag. Mixing with other waste is strictly prohibited.

(b) their waste segregation site is having some space issue and hence there *may arise a time when they may stop collecting dry waste.* In preparation, please start washing & drying any wet bags or cartons before putting that into the dry waste bag so that in case of a stoppage, it does not stink.

4. Fumigation vendor has not got a pass & hence *daily  fumigation won't be taking place till further notice.*

5. The validity of our preventive measures gets *extended to April 14* in line with the government order *Please continue to follow all preventive measures advised till date, be it on social distancing or going out or sanitization etc.*

6. The surroundings being quiet and the weather being very hot, *chances of snakes coming out from their hideouts can not be ruled out.* With the cluster of dry leaves etc, they may find a spot to take shelter. Hence please take necessary precautions while getting out of your villa & ensure everyone in the family is made aware of it.


*Appreciate your  support on all the measures and efforts specific to Covid19 prevention as well as general maintenance in the layout*

*STAY AT HOME & STAY SAFE!*

4/1/20, 8:56 AM - Bhagavan: Good morning all,

Yesterday I saw around 10 police personnel at the police outpost near decathlon flyover.
I felt I should show my respect to their dedication to duty under testing times & on a hot day by serving them butter milk which I did.
They were happy to receive it.

An acknowledgement by the "head of the post" :
*"Thank you for serving, Thank you for recognizing us as human beings, Thank you for showing concern"* made me share this with you all that even a small gesture makes them feel that there are people who care for their well being too. Thanks

4/1/20, 10:49 AM - JRSanthosh: Hi Friends,
COVID19 situation is causing real hardships to every one and any one we know. 
Its also given us an opportunity to realize the importance of each human being in making our day to day lives comfortable and respect them more.
I am sure all of you are reaching out and doing your best to comfort those in need around us.

 Its the 1st day of the month, so if you can transfer money to your maids, car wash persons and others who were helping us digitally that would be minimum way we can express our gratitude towards them.

Also Devendra who takes of ironing clothes for our community reached out to us yesterday for some help.  As you all know he is been out of business for nearly last 3 weeks. I am reaching out to you if you can contribute some amount. The total amount I am having in mind is about Rs.10 to 12K
If you are interested in making your
contribution, please reply with a Yes to this message before 4 pm today. Depending on how many 'Yes" I receive we can decide how much money each of us need to contribute. The amount may vary from Rs.150 to Rs.400 depending on how many people say Yes. 

Right now I need a 'Yes' from those people willing to contribute.
After 4pm I will send out the amount each of you need to contribute.

Please transfer the Money to my Paytm after I communicate the amount each of us need to contribute.

If any of you have transferred the amount already, please let me know that as well.

 **** STAY HOME STAY SAFE **** 
Thanks!

4/3/20, 12:30 PM - JRVenu: *Dear Residents,*

The last few days since the lockdown have been difficult on all of us.  We are all doing things differently  be it about work, play, food or even movements.
We need to keep this control on  for a few more days.  The more effectively we do, the more safer we are and more healthier we are as a community.

We also want to make a request to all of you… *Of late, we are increasingly noticing kids and adults being casual about the need for social distancing.* We understand that it is very difficult for us to manage kids and their movement.  But this (as you know) is for their own health and for the health of every member of the community (especially the most vulnerable ones ).  *So, please talk to everyone in the family and make them understand that this is for their health and for the community.*

On a lighter note, many kids (some adults too) are reminded of social distancing when they see few office bearers face to face while  walking.  This is funny because they seem to think that it is just a rule that we (association) have put and do not realize that it is for their good and for the community.  *Please note that we do not believe in "policing"… 😊 this is true even when  any of us give a friendly advice.*

Sorry for the long message… but hope all of you are onboard on this one and talk to kids and adults alike regarding the need to maintain *what is the prime need of today - "SOCIAL DISTANCING".*


*STAY AT HOME & STAY SAFE!*

Regards,
Management Committee

4/14/20, 11:14 PM - JRVinay: *Dear Residents,*
 
Appreciate your  support thus far  on all the measures and efforts specific to Covid19 prevention. Following are further *updates/information* post our previous communication along with reiteration of some important points/observations...

1) The validity of our preventive measures gets *extended to 3rd May* in line with the government order. *Request for continue to follow all preventive measures advised till date*.

2) All of us have been managing successfully one of the most difficult task i.e  distancing, managing kids inside house etc. Request to continue with the same and *not to let ourselves, kids or senior citizens group with others.* Specific to proper orientation to kids, please show them a video attached below and make them understand the need.

3) There has been observation of increased number of community vehicles getting out/in.  We believe deliveries are getting better. Our request is to totally avoid or if it is so really critical, minimise  such moves since *any outside exposure could prove too costly now*. Our main gate security is keeping a log of all such movements & the association may choose to notify the concerned.

4) Increased visits/walks to the vegetable shop right oppsite to the main gate/near-by gated communities has been observed and request to minimise/avoid such movements. 

5) Similarly, our request to avoid any visits of relatives / friends from outside has been honoured by the majority. While thanking you for that, request to maintain it till further notice. 

6) Anyone forced to take out a vehicle, once back,  please leave the vehicle under sunlight  away from the car porch of the Villa for a long duration. *Please continue to sanitize and take precautions for all your deliveries, purchases, garbage bin etc while handling/getting into the house.*

7) The surroundings being quiet and the weather being very hot, *chances of snakes coming out from their hideouts can not be ruled out.* With the cluster of dry leaves etc, they may find a spot to take shelter. Hence please take necessary precautions while getting out of your villa & ensure everyone in the family is made aware of it. Also, please educate your children not to crowd & shout near a place where a snake is spotted and catching efforts are underway. A recent catching effort near the security cabin in phase 2 could not succeed since the snake ran away due to the commotion created by the kids before the catcher arrived. 

8) *Avoiding spread,  individually and as a community,  is the motivation and aim of all these efforts.* Any one villa getting in the unfortunate grip of this disease may impact the well-being of the whole community. We appreciate alert residents highlighting to us violations to guidelines whenever the same was observed. Necessary action has been taken from our end and will continue to do so. 

*Once again thank you for your attention on the communications and cooperation in following all the measures.*

*STAY AT HOME & STAY SAFE!*

Regards,
Management Committee

4/23/20, 9:25 AM - +91 94484 61513: Hi All,

A few farmers from around Bangalore are trying to sell their grapes directly to apartment complexes. Considering the lockdown, exports & even transportation to across states is significantly hampered. These farmers approached food based WhatsApp group admins & sought help to organize farmers markets in apartments. One such group - Eonfoody has successfully enabled sales of over a tonne of grapes in areas such as Richmond Town, Cooke Town & Kalyan Nagar. This group is now enabling access to more locations as the fresh batch of grapes gets ready for harvest. 

A new batch is arriving into Bangalore on 24th April morning. Eonfoody is planning the schedule & has lined up 2 hour slots in various gated communities such as Rohan Jharokha where these farmers would put up a farmers market from 11am to 1pm. Available slots are 8am to 10am, 2pm to 4pm & 5pm to 7pm. Do let us know if your apartment would be open to the idea of a farmers market. All due precaution related to social distancing & hygiene will be adopted.

The farmers are selling Bangalore Blue grapes (used specifically for making grape juice & wine due to its favorable taste) & green seedless grapes (medium sized). 

Cost per box - Bangalore Blue Grapes: with seeds in 5kg box - Rs. 170 
Green Seedless grapes (2 kg box costs Rs. 140).

Payment mode: cash / Gpay / PayTM. 

For more information, you can reach Cecil on whatapp no. 9686190750

Look forward to your support.

4/23/20, 6:50 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Forwarding from ahad Euohoria  residents group:

IMP :: Varthur Police visit to Euphoria Campus!

Dear Resident ,

We had an incident reported in the morning at main gate where 2-3 persons were trying to enter apartment as visitor without telling security about the actual flat or wing they wanted to visit.

Security alerted EC , we went there and confronted the same to which there was a little argument and upon forcing and restraining them to visit apartment they showed their ID card and raveled that they are from Varthur Police station and doing random checks on the apartment.

It was again emphasized by them, entire apartment will be sealed if any one is found out to be roaming without any purpose.

This would lead to stop the delivery of Milk, Grocery and entries of house keeping along with Security.

There will be more frequents visit by them in upcoming days, as per what they have told.

We herewith, request resident to not come out from their home until they need to go to club house for essentials. Even at club house while buying grocery in city mandi. Please wear mask and maintain proper social distancing.

We have asked security to stop free movement of residents in path way along with open space like park / near fountains.

Please note : This is the last formal communication from EC on this topic , if any one found violating the guidelines shared by Government of India we would not be taking an any responsibility of any visit by police in our society.

Also , would note down the flat no.'s of individual residents violating these rules.

In case of any mishap , please note that once apartment is sealed it would be more problematic impact for us compared to what Covid 19 can do!

Kindly consider , this is for your own safety.

Regards ,
EC!

Please do understand that this is the perfect hiding places of snakes and other unwanted things. Please talk to your kids and ask them not to do that. I willl not take names... So I hope all of the parents talk to their kids and guide them on these dangerous habits. No one wants a sad accident in any of the houses.
4/25/20, 8:23 AM - JRSrini: Actually, I saw small kids (age group of 6-8) climbing trees (>8ft) in the dark last evening. Tried to explain them ‘not to’ but they won’t listen. I hope nothing untoward happens & then we realise the mistake.

4/28/20, 6:42 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: Hi 

I hope you all are doing well.

We're happy to share that my firm Manthan and a few like-minded individuals and organisations have recently come together and launched Thoda Bahut (https://thodabahut.org), an open community initiative, unique in it ability to bring together supplies, logistics, and funds to make an immediate and fast local impact on affected communities. Thoda Bahut is built on one of India's leading fundraiser platform and NGO called GiveIndia.org. More on the mission and how it works on https://thodabahut.org/faq/ 

The scope of the first campaign is to deliver supplies to thousands of frontline healthcare professionals and the police force in Bangalore. And support families of 15000 auto drivers who have no income right now. A list of current on-ground activities can be seen at https://thodabahut.org/activity/

We're expanding as we go. Any organization may come forward to extend this platform to make a local impact, for this community or another of their interest, or replicate the model in another city.

We would love to have your participation and share this story onward to your friends. Personally, I would love to have your ideas on how we can take this farther.

Thanks, and stay safe,
Jagan

Not only Villa no.1 painting works, internal painting works at Club house are also in progress.

I believe construction daily wage labour have had atleast 40 days of 'labour days' till yesterday. The least one can do is to support their livelihoods by providing work.

For a bit of perspective during these frustrating times, imagine you were born in 1900. 
On your 14th birthday, World War I starts, and ends on your 18th birthday. 22 million people perish in that war. Later in the year, a Spanish Flu epidemic hits the planet and runs until your 20th birthday. 50 million people die from it in those two years. Yes, 50 million. On your 29th birthday, the Great Depression begins. Unemployment hits 25%, the World GDP drops 27%. That runs until you are 33. The country nearly collapses along with the world economy. When you turn 39, World War II starts. You aren’t even over the hill yet. And don’t try to catch your breath. On your 41st birthday, the United States is fully pulled into WWII. Between your 39th and 45th birthday, 75 million people perish in the war. At 50, the Korean War starts. 5 million perish. At 55 the Vietnam War begins and doesn’t end for 20 years. 4 million people perish in that conflict. On your 62nd birthday you have the Cuban Missile Crisis, a tipping point in the Cold War. Life on our planet, as we know it, should have ended. Great leaders prevented that from happening. When you turn 75, the Vietnam War finally ends. Think of everyone on the planet born in 1900. How do you survive all of that? When you were a kid in 1985 and didn’t think your 85 year old grandparent understood how hard school was. And how mean that kid in your class was. Yet they survived everything listed above.
Perspective is an amazing thing. 
Let’s try and keep things in perspective. 
Let’s be smart, help each other out.

5/3/20, 8:25 AM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

Central and state governments have been providing revised guidelines for the lockdown and expected to keep getting updated versions based on the situation.  One of the recent revisions allowed for construction work to be started provided the workers are on-site and do not need to travel from a distant place to get to the work location.

Those owners who have been holding the workers on-site/in the vicinity since the lockdown have sought permission from the association for some specific works that are done inside of the Villa.  After appropriate reviews, whoever is falling within the scope of the govt circular has been permitted to work with appropriate conditions. 

Villa 1 and the associated workers (painters)  meet the guidelines put forth by the government.  Hence they are allowed to work and accordingly will be applicable for other under construction activities also.

*Specific to our operations, this is the only relaxation applicable as of now and we will communicate on any other relaxations that impact the community as needed which will be based on further understanding/updates/revised guidelines.*

As all of us are trying to get back to normalcy, there are also lookouts for opportunities to get some options (not only essentials but other next level requirements) within the community that can be made accessible to residents in a planned manner while maintaining social distancing and other precautions. *E.g.  A2B van was one such step to check if this could be managed.* These steps are again to help to minimize residents' outside exposure. 

On another important note, as things start opening up and movement of people and material starts, we need to be more cautious and measures need to be taken for few weeks to avoid exposure in community *until we get clarity on impacts of lockdown relaxations. Post lockdown relaxations, along with continuing to follow other measures practicing "Villa Level Isolation" at a similar level as was observed during lockdown beginning would be very important once family members need to step out for work-related and other activities.*

*Also given the dynamic nature of the situation, rapidly changing information from various authorities/sources, complexities involved, various individual requests from members, etc. takes time for MC to analyze, and execute which causes sometimes delay in communication. All efforts are to get as much as relaxation possible at earliest to get back to normalcy but at the same time we are going to proceed cautiously.*

Thanks in advance for your understanding and patience.

Request you to drop an email at association id - jrgassociation@gmail.com - for any concern/suggestion.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

5/5/20, 8:20 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Press release

A few BESCOM consumers have repeatedly complained that the bill received during May 2020 have been calculated irrationally and charged higher rates. The reason being that while computing the readings the BESCOM has charged higher rates without considering the basic slab rates. Therefore, the consumers feel that the bill charged is more than the actual consumption of power. The BESCOM likes to issue a clarification on this regard as follows.

In the wake of lockdown announced owing to Covid 19 pandemonium, as per the directions of the Energy Department, the BESCOM has issued electricity bills to all the HT and LT and 40 HP and above installations based on the actual reading, while for all other categories of consumers, bill was issued based on the average readings of their preceding months. It was made it clear that it is only a one time measure for the month of April 2020. And the regular billing and collection activity would resume as before from the month of May 2020 onwards. Any difference in the average bill and the actual reading would be adjusted in the subsequent moth bill.

In domestic category, due to various reasons including increase in the use of fans, ACs, and as many of the IT and BT as well as other sector personal are working from home, the maximum demand reading and consumption has gone slightly higher in the month of April. Consequently the meter reading done in the month of May the meter reading done has been high for the domestic category. Also the unpaid amount of the April month has been added resulting in higher amount.
 The BESCOM categorically makes it clear that all rationals have been followed while calculating the electricity bills.

If the consumers feel that the bill charged is more than the actual consumption and also the the bill is calculated irrationally without following norms can make complaints at BESCOM Helpline 1912 and get redressal.

5/9/20, 6:59 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents
Further to our message this morning, appreciate your patience while we were deliberating the way forward specific to domestic help. In line with the recent government notification of relaxing the rules around lockdown as well as inputs from other RWAs around, the MC in today's meeting finalized the following process for us in JRG:

1) "KYS - Know your support-staff" form is being introduced which has the first 2 pages for filling up and submission & the rest containing specific instructions/guidelines for you to refer. Each villa owner who is wanting to get the services of a  maid  is expected to fill up this form, sign it and submit to association email ID [jrgassociation@gmail.com] with CC to our estate manager's mail id (jrg.estatemanager@gmail.com)  

2) One (1) form has to be submitted per villa per support-staff. At this point, you are to fill up & submit the form only for maid help & not for any other. Even if a maid is working in more than one villa, it is mandatory for each service taking the owner to fill up and submit this form.

3)  The KYS form will be reviewed for each support staff and in case of potential issues/clarifications, the concerned villa-owner will be contacted.

4) Temperature checks will be performed at the main-gate using a non-contact thermometer for all support staff entering the complex - Residents need to make their support staff aware of the extra step at the gate.

5) The support staff is expected to follow all other precautions like the use of masks, frequent hand wash, sanitizers, social distance, etc while being within the JRG complex.

At this point, the above process will be prioritized ONLY for "Maids", considering the volume of information that may be needed to be processed /reviewed. Key timelines for the "maid" forms are 
a) Submit all forms for maids by Tuesday 12th May, 5 p.m.
b) Maid re-entry into JRG will open on Sunday 17th May (13-16th will be processing & other preparatory time)
c) If a resident misses the deadline for 12th May, they can still submit the form later - However, it can/may take a cycle time of up to 1 week from the date of submission before the reviews of those forms can be concluded.

The MC decided to release the timeline for the rest of the support-staff in due course of time since this exercise is going to be done in phases. Consequent to this allowance, previously intimated guidelines on the way residents conduct outside of their Villas would become even more stringent and hence a separate message would follow on that. Thanks for your support and patience as we try and get our processes streamlined in the new times!

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

5/9/20, 7:34 PM - +91 97405 83964: One basic question, how do we print this form if our printers are out of order because of no ink? Do we get these forms from main gate?
5/9/20, 7:47 PM - +91 99021 44333: Does this mean that they come and fill the form and then go back and wait for permission to return to work on 17th.
5/9/20, 7:47 PM - +91 99021 44333: Isn't that lockdown easing on 17th May anyway?
5/9/20, 7:48 PM - +91 99021 44333: Can't we ask them to fill the form over the weekend and start on Monday?
5/9/20, 7:51 PM - JRVenu: Hi All... you can update the info in the word version of the document and put your digital signature and PDF the file before you send it.  Do note that we do not require the signature/thumbprint of the maid... we just need you to fill the maid info
5/9/20, 7:52 PM - JRVenu: Also please note that once the info is submitted... we need time to go through the info and make sure no RED flags.  hence the processing time.
5/9/20, 7:53 PM - JRVenu: We need the info to ensure that we limit/stop the possibility of virus.  Hence the info about where they were in the last 21 days etc.
5/9/20, 7:56 PM - +91 99021 44333: Will this process be followed after the lockdown period?
5/9/20, 7:56 PM - +91 98802 82111: Yes need a clarification on this!
5/9/20, 7:59 PM - +91 96202 12548: https://www.livemint.com/mint-lounge/features/lockdown-3-0-confusion-anger-over-the-entry-of-domestic-help-in-urban-centres-11588671231538.html
5/9/20, 8:00 PM - +91 96202 12548: 'If it bothered male RWA members, they would find a solution'

One of the subtexts of the debate is the fact that most RWAs are made of male residents, with low female representation, and it is mostly women demanding the re-entry of domestic workers—understandably because they shoulder a disproportionate amount of domestic work in the absence of hired help.
5/9/20, 8:04 PM - JRNidhi: A lot of maids have gone to their villages. Once they come back, they need to be quarantined before resuming work. In such cases, we can employ maids coming from Urban Clap. They are doing sufficient background checks - do they need to fill in this form as well ? How would it be different than calling a technician from UC?
5/9/20, 8:06 PM - +91 98802 82111: How many days of quarantine is required once the maids return from their respective villages...
5/9/20, 9:27 PM - JRNidhi: This is what I was talking about

5/10/20, 1:06 PM - +91 96202 12548: Can anybody please share me privately  a contact of good civil lawyer you have used in the past? Thanks
5/10/20, 1:10 PM - +91 81054 49494: Is this enforceable? Are we signing this for all help/labour current and future?
5/10/20, 1:11 PM - +91 96202 12548: Also are the construction workers who are in JR filled these forms?
5/10/20, 1:12 PM - +91 81054 49494: Do we need to sign it for visitors. They carry identical risks for community
5/10/20, 1:15 PM - JRNiranjan: The declaration is not a legal binding, but a moral obligation towards our community. 

Nowadays, people don't even respect what's signed on a construction agreement, why so much fuss, I don't understand.

I see a small section of posts against the decisions taken. That's how it is !
5/10/20, 1:16 PM - JRNiranjan: Sir, Please do. We can wait until your lawyer gives a clearance ;) !
5/10/20, 1:19 PM - +91 96202 12548: Niranjan, this is for something else but good point I can ask them too ;)
5/10/20, 1:19 PM - JRNiranjan: This exercise also helps us gather information and be prepared in the event something goes wrong.
5/10/20, 1:34 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: This message was deleted
5/10/20, 1:36 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: before giving in writing would like to hear from other villa owners who are giving in writing to know their opinion - if common agreement is that it's ok then we can sign and give it - shall we form a small group to discuss this ?
5/10/20, 1:40 PM - +91 99021 44333: Dear Sir, Since it's a small group, a small number can start tomorrow and if it's only information that is needed for data collection reasons doesn't seem to be a rational for starting after one week
5/10/20, 2:05 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Had discussed with 3-4 villa owners and I think we got the middle ground to solve this before giving in writing this form - closing this thread which I started  ( thanks MCs for coming up  with  detailed write up and supporting staff rule which can help our community to be safe and corona free)
5/10/20, 2:07 PM - +91 96202 12548: I am all for starting economic activity whether it's construction or domestic help. But the so called "I see only a few section of posts against the decision" is primarily because there is a ban against any retorts or constructive discussions on this group. Mails sent to  association id go unacknowledged. Most people would rather not say much than waste their time arguing with a wall.
5/10/20, 2:32 PM - +91 97405 83964: I hope villa 1 owner and other villa owners (who have started construction activities) have already submitted this letter to the associationn for each construction worker. Because construction workers were allowed last week itself.


And also association should submit this letter for jrg manager and all other house keeping staff and all other staff who are working in society and are coming from outside.
5/10/20, 2:40 PM - JRNiranjan: 👍🏼🙂
5/10/20, 2:40 PM - JRNiranjan: We will comply Sir
5/10/20, 2:44 PM - +91 99021 44333: *so we will comply for maid
5/10/20, 2:46 PM - +91 97405 83964: In that case, all villa owners should be given this flexibility to comply for househelp within some period of time. And house helps should be allowed immediately.

Also I believe with the same rule (as for the house helps), only one construction worker should be allowed per villa.
5/10/20, 3:01 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: IMo, we can close this discussion here and bring up specifics to MCs notice separately ( if needed see how we can support too and solve issues set of residents facing)
5/10/20, 3:10 PM - +91 99021 72172: While I am still understanding the hurry and desperation from all of us to get back to as before, I sincerely pray that maids /cooks who work closely with us are intelligent enough to see that we too may infect them and they only do what is necessary.

Why are we not seeing this -- that in case if we who are in hurry to get 'coronated' and 'live with corona' infect our maids, in such case also we need their information to help / assist / inform their locality friends  and family.... 

I really appreciate and thank OBs And MCs who have put effort talking to various other communities and coming up with detailed information sheet. Let's not forget community is made of highly immune and weaker individuals. While providing this information if we make ourselves answerable, I see it as nothing but looking out for every individual in the community.
5/10/20, 3:11 PM - +91 99021 72172: Ok. Saw your msg now. 🙂
5/10/20, 3:17 PM - JRNiranjan: Sir, whatever comes to our mind can be the suggestions :).

  MC will decide.
5/10/20, 7:00 PM - JRRahul: We are experiencing constant fluctuation from main power? Any other villa experiencing the same?
5/11/20, 7:50 AM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents

5/14/20, 1:01 PM - JRVenu: Dear Members / Residents,

During the past few days, our association mail id has received multiple emails from various members.  While we encourage members to raise questions and queries to the association, the MC has felt that some emails were very aggressive, abusive, and in some cases derogatory.

We want to let you all know that all emails that come into association mail id & seeking a response do get appropriate attention.  We need you to understand that some of the mails/requests need the MC to review before the response is sent to the sender and hence will take time.  You may also note that the regular MC meetings take place on a monthly basis and only just recently we did meet as needed due to the current COVID issues.

Also important when you are sending the emails, recommend that these emails and messages should be professional and with due consideration of the amount of work that is required. Do note that any emails that are derogatory/abusive will result in the sender arguing "with a wall". Hence writer discretion is highly recommended if he/she is looking for an answer.

Please also note that the association or its office bearers do not treat differently a member for raising a concern as long as the same is genuine and not pointing fingers. This becomes even more important because MC members are not employees of the association and are volunteering their time and investing their valuable personal time in service to this JRG community. 

So, once again, do not expect a reply the moment an email hits the association mail deck. For the sender to know that the mail has been received, an auto acknowledgment message has been configured so that the sender does not need to follow up with a reminder. 

Please do take note and act appropriately, which will be in the best interest of the community. Thanks in advance for your understanding & co-operation.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

5/14/20, 3:43 PM - +91 97405 83964: Rats might be entering from your utility drainage (yes, they are capable of pushing the lid up). And Rats hate onions/garlic smell. So putting few garlic cloves might help.

I could successfully catch one with the glue board. :)
5/14/20, 3:44 PM - +91 97318 77400: No,  not in the house... the car!

5/14/20, 4:53 PM - +91 96202 12548: This is frankly very dangerous. Replacing the entire wiring can cost a bomb.  Try not to keep any food in the car. Get a wire mesh casing done under the engine, some dealers do it for you. Based on the internet I tried spraying diesel under the hood. Believe rats don't like the smell of diesel.
5/14/20, 6:08 PM - JRVenu: Hi Everyone,

While the form submission for approval of Maid's re-entry is currently on,  a few members of the community have written to us seeking urgent assistance of a gardener little earlier than planned in our phased release system announced earlier. While we understand the concerns raised for these requests, we are not in a position to disturb the process finalized nor are we in a position to provide our association gardener to attend to these urgent requests due to the acute staff shortage that we already have.  

To support such urgent requests which can not wait for the next 2 weeks, 
one of the gardeners who are familiar with the community has been contacted by our Estate Manager and a KYS run completed via phone call, which will be formalized at the entry stage.  He is willing to come and do the gardening for a fee of Rs.500 for 2 hours (as per the gardener).  The 2 requests that we got have been passed on to our Estate Manager (Jayaram) and anyone else needing this service may please contact Jayaram. The service will be on a first come first served basis and subject to the gardener's availability.

Do note that:
*1. This is an interim arrangement until the KYS process for your regular  Gardener is in place*
*2. The specific service needed and his availability is something that each villa needs to coordinate with Jayaram.*
*3. We have the background check done for only this gardener..... No one else will be allowed during this interim period.*
*4. Interim arrangement done here is purely on the grounds of resident safety & such an arrangement will not be available for other categories that will follow the next batch processing.*


Kind regards,

MC, JRGSHOA

5/16/20, 8:19 PM - JRSanthosh: Dear Residents,

*Update on the maids/ Domestic helps entry into the community.*
 
 *17 Villas submitted forms till 5pm today* . Their maids will be allowed entry from tomorrow.  

 **Going forward* , if any villa resident wants entry for any new Regular Domestic Help (maid/cook/gardner/driver/car cleaner), they should fill the form we have sent earlier for each domestic help and submit to Jayaram via email .
Jayram will process these forms, update the security staff accordingly and communicate back to you ASAP. 
After you receive the  communication back from Jayaram, these persons will be allowed entry from the next day. 

Please note that ONLY the Domestic help that have forms submitted will be allowed by the security staff.

 *During the entry each day,* 
-- the temperature of the Domestic Help person is checked (<37 deg).
-- is expected to wash hands with the soap at the main gate and wear mask.
--Wearing mask is compulsory at all times when the person is within the community
--The security has been asked to not allow gathering/chit chatting between maids/domestic help.
--No spitting is allowed within the community campus. 

We recommend the  Residents to reinforece these messages with your Domestic Help persons and ask them to comply with the same. 

 In addition to the above we recommend that you keep track of
1. Any travel history they (and their family) might have especially in RED and ORANGE zones, and allow them to work accordingly following due government guidelines.
2. Check the Covid-19 status in their localities on daily basis
3. Install Arogya Setu app and ask your maids also to install Arogya Setu app 
4. Know which all villas or any other apartment your maid visits
5. Ensure they wash their hands and legs with Soap before they enter your home
6. Ensure they wear mask inside your home at all times.
7. Ensure small kids and adults with other risk factors maintain safe distance

Thank you for all the support and help us keep our community Covid-19 free.

5/19/20, 8:04 PM - JRVinay: Dear Residents,

In line with relaxation given by Govt. and the residents meeting we had on Sunday, the following decisions have been taken by MC and applicable from now on:

1) All helpers to the villas will be allowed with submission of forms to Jayaram and a quick review done by him to ensure all in order
2) All outside service providers like Urban Clap, Swiggy, Amazon, Newspapers etc will be allowed for door step services.
3) Construction workers to be strictly monitored for compliance like wearing mask etc. Not allowed to go to any place other than specific construction site. Adherence to be ensured by respective construction villa owner.
4) Club house will remain closed until all repairs and work is done.

To reiterate expectations from residents for their own safety and others in the layout:

a) Try to take delivery and handle packages with caution as most of us might already be doing.
b) Try to limit service personnel entry till respective villa parking area. If someone needs to enter the villa for service, ensure they wear a mask, get their hands washed and any other precautions before entering in the villa.
c) Maintain information on support staff like maids, car drivers, gardeners etc. with guidelines  published earlier, including but not limited to where they are living and other places they are working,be it inside our layout or outside etc.
d) If not essential or critical, restrict/limit soliciting external visitors.
e) Maintain social distancing as being done now and educate children to do the same.

5/20/20, 8:18 AM - JrAditya: *Has your Car Battery failed?... Read on.*

There is a good chance that many car batteries haven't got the sufficient charge in the last 50 days.

Hence expecting many cars and bikes would need replacement.

Keep the below contact handy. I have been using Amaron Batteries from Somanatha Enterprises since 2012. It's a company store of Amaron (not a multi brand store). Very reliable service, home deliveries and check-ups of batteries.

Yesterday I replaced two heavy batteries of my UPS from them, and hence thought of sharing this number.

If you contact then can ask for "Anji" mechanic as he knows the JR Greenwich society now.

5/23/20, 10:41 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Dear all,
Just in case you are planning to buy cotton masks that are wash proof and not sure where to get them, here is a good supplier that a few of us thought good to go based on comparative analysis and having already used them. These are made by a group of  ladies from a  self help group based in a Village near Kengeri and supported by a NGO in sales and door delivery.  These come in 3ply elastic type (E1 to E6) and 3 ply tying type (the four individual pics)  priced at Rs.50 per piece (door delivery price). If interested in buying, please message Jayaram and depending on the number, a decision could be made to open a Google spreadsheet to capture individual pattern preferences for collating & indenting.  Thanks

6/1/20, 8:16 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents,

In the recent past, we have recieved many complaints from Residents as well as Security guards regarding high decibel noise coming from few Villas post 10 p.m. The contributing factors of such noises have been playing loud music, post dinner loud chats/laughter including personal conference calls going well past midnight, celebrations involving bursting of balloons & crackers well past midnight and the like.

In this regard, please note that our bye-law specifically prohibits such actions leading to inconvenience including sleep deprivation to the immediate neighbours. Wherever such incidence was brought to our security guards notice, they have gone to the concerned Villa and notified them. However, the association mail id has received heads up  message from the aggrieved residents stating that  the next call would be to police and not to our security should this repeat. 

Through this message, the residents are once again  requested to follow the guidelines applicable post 10 p.m. with out fail and just in case of any violations, our Estate Office / security / association shall not be a party to any proceedings by the law enforcement office if it goes to that.

Kindly co-operate. Thanks

6/4/20, 7:51 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Owners/Tenants, 

You are requested to ensure that any move in/move outs  are in alignment with the applicable rules/regulations including the cut off timings.

There was a frantic  request this  Monday night for allowing late move out. After multiple calls back & forth and few EC members spending time in reviewing what the issue was, a one time exception was given specially on humanitarian grounds. Also staff had to monitor this till well beyond midnight. We do not want this type of a situation to recur any more needing  impromptu calls /meetings etc.  Please plan well  with sufficient buffer to avoid need for exceptions which will not be granted.

Attached move in/move out  forms are for ready  reference. In addition to filling them, please carefully read the conditions to help plan the move efficiently.

Kindly co-operate. Thanks

One of them is

6/11/20, 10:19 AM - +91 96638 49641: This is to bring to everyone's notice that yesterday evening around 5 pm, a guy jumped from the other side of the compound wall into our skating rink. Our kids were playing in the skating rink that time. This was noticed by one of the  domestic help and she later informed the security guards.

I learnt from Jayaram today that he was a thief who did a robbery in Kodathi and was trying to run and hide in our campus. STP guy tried to catch hold of him, but could not.  

It's not even been a year since the last big robbery happened in our community. This incident just highlights that we're still not quite safe around here. We have a temporary barbed wire fixture around the compound wall, but clearly it's not enough to keep intruders at bay. All they need is a simple jump to get inside, that too in broad daylight. 

Request the association to look into this issue, and secure the compound wall with a more effective solution. Thanks!

6/12/20, 9:08 AM - JRVinay: Dear Residents,

In the light of Wednesday 's incident where a stranger trespassed through our common area, few members from our security sub-committee along with Jayaram and security field officers reviewed all aspects including  CCTV footages. The gist of it points to a possibility of this guy having committed a crime elsewhere and was being chased by few people. In an effort to escape, he was running helter skelter including trespassing. The security agency has been asked to intimate this incident to the jurisdictional police. 

As you are aware, there is a standing security sub-committee (Jayaram is also part of the group) to handle security related issues.  Sub-committee will  review, plan and work on further activities in this regard, including related communications/updating residents etc.

*Interested volunteers are requested to join this sub-committee to support these tasks.*

*Also request to have extra vigil and care specially given the current situation.*

6/25/20, 2:13 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents,

In continuation of earlier communication related to noise issues in the community, a reminder of the policy specific to this has been sent. Still there are occasional complaints on this issue from residents and just to re-iterate again on the steps to follow:

a) inform main gate security if unbearable sound is coming from nearby Villa/s
b) security will visit the concerned Villa & inform the concerned resident/individual linked to the noise source.
c) drop an email to association email id and association manager mail id for records and necessary action as called for, including penalty for such offence.

*Note:* in spite of the warning from the security, if the concerned resident/individual continues with the noise pollution or keeps repeating, and if impacted resident/s having sought to seek law enforcement officer's intervention to handle such issues, the residents  involved in the noise issue shall be responsible to manage the proceedings thereafter. The association members or any of its staff including security shall not become a party to it. 

Thank you for the continued support.

Were there no safety grills underneath the glass? Would you be knowing the glass thickness and dimensions? Typically, big size glasses are to be avoided and instead to be placed in smaller tiles.
6/25/20, 4:38 PM - JRHimanshu: With broken pcs it looks like that it was a toughened glass. If that is the case then it shouldn't break. 🤔. 

We have got it done in Balcony, toughened with 12mm thickness.
6/25/20, 4:47 PM - +91 99459 37777: One option is to have two 12mm thick glasses sticking by a 1.5mm PVB (?) layer. In that case, even if the glass breaks, the layer won’t let it fall. I can send you the specification.
6/25/20, 4:53 PM - +1 (617) 417-6626: Its definitely very thick, so it’s strange that it broke

6/25/20, 9:05 PM - JrGopal128Wood: *Dear Residents,*

All of us are  routinely getting updated about the goings on in Bangalore in terms of the number of Covid infections, which is currently on a day to day increasing trend.  With the recent opening up of our gates for domestic helps, un-avoidable freelance service guys etc. and a few of the residents going out to office locations as well, we too need to do a sanity check on our strict compliance to previously communicated advisories. The MC members reviewed and  felt an urgent need to re-iterate the following :

(1) *Wearing of masks while stepping out of your Villa* : Please note that this has been a mandatory requirement and more so now irrespective whether you are walking within the layout. Authorities have started surprise checks and impose spot fines for violations. Please follow this practice with out fail with immediate effect not to escape from the penalties but to save from the Virus.
(2) *Distancing* : 
Over and above wearing of masks, the other key measure is to maintain  safe distance between people irrespective of the age group. When it comes to being on main/cross roads as well as the park, our residents - especially the younger ones and seniors alike are back to how they were during the pre-lockdown period.  The  applicable guideline is seldom followed. Can we all agree to literally enforce this need of the hour in the interest of respective families in particular and our community in general ? We look up to the head of the family in each Villa to take personal responsibility towards this goal. We do not expect security guards to enforce this requirement since they were ridiculed at times when they tried to do so on behalf of the MC.
(3) *Intimation to association regarding anyone in the family having arrived from a travel & needing to undergo quarantine*: We had clearly communicated earlier the need to intimate us about any member/guest into a Villa who has  travelled from designated locations outside of the state. Thanks to those residents who promptly informed via email to association id with details of individuals who come under this category. However, based on intimations from few residents, we are of the opinion that some may have missed. Please make sure the same is meticulously followed and also ensure that the concerned members who are to undergo home quarantine follow strict quarantine guidelines for the prescribed duration.

Thank you for your attention, understanding and  support. *Follow the guidelines & Stay safe*

6/30/20, 10:39 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Dear Residents,

As we read about the increase in Covid19 +ve cases in Bangalore,  just a while ago we got to know from a reliable source that one of the shops (Gupta provision stores) in Hadosiddapura  and all other shops around that area have been  ordered shut till further notice due to a confirmed  CoVid19 +ve case.

We realize that some of you might have maids/helpers living in the close vicinity.  We advice you to take abundant caution and check where your maid/helper stays and if at all found staying close to this known case of CoVid-19, you should restrict the entry of such maid/helper into JRG.

We advice you to take  abundant precaution in the coming days.

7/3/20, 11:21 AM - JRVinay: Dear Residents,

From a review of all the  domestic helps currently visiting  villas in our layout, we have reasons to believe that a few may have missed filling up the form on the pretext that another villa owner has already filled up the form who is availing the services of the same help.  As communicated earlier, *it is mandatory to submit separate form/s for each domestic help that each villa is engaging.* In case not done or missed,  then please do the submission immediately to continue domestic help's entry for your villa.

*Also, keeping in mind the developments in surrounding areas, as and when you change or hire new domestic help for your villa,  please do a fresh submission to allow entry as well as to track in case of any urgent need to communicate.*

In cases of a common help serving more than one villa and if  one of them is undergoing home quarantine,  they are expected to strictly follow the quarantine guidelines and inform the other Villa owner/s who are commonly served by the same help of action taken viz. necessary precautions/measures  including temporary discontinuation of concerned domestic helps. Request you to plan accordingly for your respective villa keeping in mind the safety of domestic help/s, residents of other villa/s for whom they are working and in general of our community at large.

Thank you for your attention and support!

Dear Pet Owners'

 Our House keeping & gardening staff have reported sighting dog poop  in many places in common  area of our layout. As stated in the bye-laws, it is the responsibility of the owner taking the pet out for walk to clean it up without fail. Please note that our housekeeping staff will not clean such mess.  Also please note that :
* the Pets should be accompanied by the Owners at all  time when they are out and can't be left free unleashed.
*  there are no bins kept in the layout for scoop disposals and the owner should find the right way to dispose. Waste Bins in common area should never be used for such diaposals please.

7/6/20, 6:36 PM - OwnerRajeshJRG: Dear Residents,

As we all are seeing the news or getting information about CoVid infections from various sources, the number of cases in Bangalore are increasing quite rapidly day by day.  You also know about the cases getting deeper and wider and  in our surroundings too. This trend is expected follow this pattern all through July based on what we hear from expert Virologists  *Which means that we need to try extra hard to safeguard our community and our families.*

We have been publishing requests to use masks when ever you are in the common areas, especially when you are in proximity (less than 6 ft) of anyone that is not your family member.  We have seen many of you comply... we want to thank you for that, but unfortunately there are still a lot of gaps in the mask wearing descipline and social distrancing.

*Due to  reasons above,  the MC members met yesterday (5th July) and decided to close the PARK, Tennis Court, and Skating Rink.  This closure is going to be in-place until end of July when we will take a decision based on the situation then.*

*Given the current situation, some residents have voluntarily  decided to discontinue their domestic helps for a short duration,  while some others are in thinking mode. We have also realized that if things get worse (number of cases increasing further rapidly in the vicinity), then we also might have to look at  limitations around all external entries as well including visitors/guests, domestic helps/maids, non essential deliveries, occasional vendors, under construction activities etc.*

But having said this, we have decided that we will (at the current point in time) only put a request for all residents to be extra vigilant and excercise high degree of care so that you keep your family and the community CoVid free.

Thank you all for the continued support and help us keep the community CoVid free.

7/7/20, 1:33 PM - +91 96633 05410: I believe Sambit's point is valid, and wanted to get that clarified. Understandably, we do not want kids group activity or adults sitting or talking in groups, and that's valid irrespective of the location whether it's the common roads or the park.
7/7/20, 1:34 PM - +91 96633 05410: If we are restricting the space for individual walking/jogging, then aren't we clogging the common roads more?
7/7/20, 1:36 PM - +91 96633 05410: True, but If it gets into a crowd gathering, then I believe individuals should themselves take a sensible call and disperse if they see more ppl (other than family) and disperse.

Personally, it doesn't make a lot of difference to me to jog on the road rather than the park, but I felt that was a valid point.

7/8/20, 9:50 AM - JRSvJayaram: Dear JRG Pet Owners,
There have been formal and informal complaints from residents about pet owners not following the stipulated guidelines with in the layout.   We have seen and also received enough complaints from residents about few dogs being taken out with out leash and some times kids taking them for walks and the dog running/charging at someone who is on a walk. There have been instances of dog poop in private lawns, vacant sites and common areas. We have communicated previously too that we are and would like to remain  a  pet friendly layout. However, the same should not be  at a cost of inconvenience to fellow residents.

With immediate effect,please ensure your pets are always under leash while stepping out of your Villa and only adults strong enough to handle them should take pets for a walk.  Ensure pets are adequately trained, especially the aggressive breeds irrespective the owner's assessment that they are friendly etc. Pets are animals whose mood swings  cannot be predicted. 

Please see below a picture of a child who was badly bitten without provocation in Adarsh Palm. The child survived after being in ICU at Sakra and the dog owner went behind bars.It is not a situation anybody wants to be in, be it the pet Owner or  the Victim.  We expect every pet owner to follow the rules without having to be enforced through Est. Manager or security. Inspite of such reminders, if the owner is found roaming around with the pet with out a leash, leaving pet poop without scooping,  the association may be forced to ask the owner to take away  the pet from the society. Please note that we have the third eye recording every movement.

Thanks for your understanding and compliance.

Have been after getting one of my uncle to a hospital bed for last 14 hours, without any success , with highest of the influences. So the situation with hospitals, is not at all good. We should look at measures like the 1st lockdown time. My two cents.

As the park is closed I am forced to walk jog in whole of the layout which I am actually enjoying... But I see dog poop in so many places. Why are we not picking up the mess which our family member has left behind?

7/20/20, 8:53 AM - JrAditya: I want to assure everyone here that none of the pet owners is so careless to leave a dog poop unattended. We take care of the pets, and are very careful of the hygiene of the society.

It's very important not to forget the stray animals (cats, dogs and even monkeys) who keep roaming around unguarded and unabashed in JRG. Don't they poop or do they go outside of JRG?

There have been enough recordings available of such strays in the society and many have seen their garbage bins ransacked and gardens having poops. No pet owner will allow such things.

Hence, a request to all:

There is an email and a coordinator (Mr. Jayaram), please use the right channel to voice. A residents group is not to discriminate against a set of people (in this case pet owners).


Sincere thanks in advance for everyone's understanding.

7/20/20, 2:16 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents
There have been a few recent incidents brought to association’s notice around car parking.
Pls note the recommendation from the association around car parking
1) Pls park your car in your villa’s designated car parking area
2) Any additional vehicle  should be parked “only” in the designated common parking area
3) Avoid parking on the side streets/crosses as they are narrower
4) In case the car is parked on the road/street, pls ensure it is done in a manner that allows large vehicles including delivery vehicles, etc to pass by without issues.
In general, as responsible residents of the community, pls ensure that your vehicle parking does not cause any inconvenience to others when they try to maneuver their vehicles
Thanks for the support.

7/26/20, 9:08 AM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

Based on the input from multiple residents and in discussion with MC members we have decided to open the *walking pathway* in the park.  Please note that the remaining park continues to be closed.

We hope that this eases the volume of people (especially during the peak hours) on the main roads, and will give a walking space for all residents.

Please do note that *ONLY THE WALKING PATHWAY* in the park is opened, and the remaining park (including the amphitheater) will stay closed.

As part of the CoVid readiness we heard that the authorities have been asking for the list of people staying in the society.

So, we wanted to be prepared and create a comprehensive list of the residents, family members (of all ages), and helpers (live-in).

We have setup a form to make the collection of this information easy.  Please go to the link https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/B2WJCMC and fill in details for ALL residents that are there in each of your villas.  Please complete this process before 10th Aug.2020

Your support and cooperation is much appreciated.

8/10/20, 7:07 AM - JRSvJayaram: Dear members, 

Majority have paid the maintenance demanded for Apr-June quarter and thanks to all who have complied.  The last date for payment was 8th August and as a special case, the MC decided to give time till 10th August without attracting late fee/charges for a few who are yet to pay.  Please note that we have one more demand to be raised in this quarter and the  account status as of Apr - June of individual member will have a bearing on ascertaining the net payable amount for July- Sept quarter. Hence clearing all dues as of Monday, the 10th August is highly  recommended. 

Please Note : 

1. Payment method/bank transfer details remains the same as was used during the earlier payments. 

2. There will be "NO extension/wiave off"  of the payment date & hence, in case of missing due date, please self calculate the late fee for respective pending due/s accordingly and process the  payment along with the late fee.

3. Any delay in payment will attract delayed charges (on daily basis) of 3% per month/36% per annum, over and above the due amount. 

4. In case of non payment of any of the late fee (even if main payment has been completed), payment status will be considered as incomplete till the day the balance payment is remitted.

5. Any application for issue of NOC (No Objection Certificate) or specific requests from members will be taken up for review only if the member concerned has cleared all past/present dues which may please be noted.

6. Voting right and other association services/participation will be available only to the members who have cleared all dues including maintenance charges (as per bye-laws).

However, not to break our annual tradition of welcoming Ganesha to JRG, few of us did Ganesha sthapana today near the swimming pool area. Those who want to pay obeisance can do so by following the current guidelines i.e with masks , one family visiting at a time and maintaining distancing. Visarjan will be tomorrow evening.

8/27/20, 4:50 PM - JRVenu: above is a message from my daughter's college. Please feel free to sign-up if interested
8/29/20, 11:25 AM - JrPrashanth47: <Media omitted>
8/29/20, 11:47 AM - JRNiranjan: Its not allowed as per our byelaws.
8/29/20, 11:58 AM - JRRahulTaneja: observed that few under construction villas have different front designs, different front lane offsets, etc than the rest in the same lane
8/29/20, 12:11 PM - +91 97405 83964: Are we going to take any action regarding this? This is having 4 floors of construction for which even bda approval was not there.
8/29/20, 1:05 PM - JRSatish34: The other under construction house in the same cross (both share same engr & contractor) is of the same height...seems like the only difference is the OHT design.
8/29/20, 1:27 PM - +91 97405 83964: Niranjan, is it allowed as per bda approval and bye laws? From the pic, it is one additional floor of construction at the top.
8/29/20, 1:37 PM - JRNiranjan: Sir, Ground+2 is allowed as per byelaw of BDA. While, both the Villas 36 and 37 have built only G+2, they have increased the height of the ground floor over 3-4 ft from a regular Villa built, for which NOC was not issued by the Association or JRH.
8/29/20, 1:38 PM - JRNiranjan: The additional floor seen in the picture is built for installing over head water tank only as informed by the owner.
8/29/20, 1:57 PM - JRSatish34: #36 and #37 are not sold yet; you mean #35 and #38.
8/29/20, 2:09 PM - JRNiranjan: Sorry, that's right Sir
8/29/20, 2:19 PM - +91 96202 12548: So are we saying that the owners deviated from the original plan approved by JRH and association? Reducing height of ground floor will not be feasible now. Should we make it mandatory to get clearance at every stage of construction to avoid this in the future?
8/29/20, 2:22 PM - JRNiranjan: Yes, we gotto do that
8/31/20, 6:06 AM - Bhagavan: FYI: I am sharing this information after discussion with few parents with the requirements of Python programming for their Kids.

9/6/20, 1:24 PM - +91 99808 47825: I have both Airtel and Netfi connection. Now spoke to Jayaram and understand that Association has decided,not to allow netfi as it is not fully piped.Now my netfi connection is disconnected.

Can Association take responsibility to provide another service provider as i need two connection immediately as i cannot depend on one service provider ? If not, then for streamlining things, we cannot impact service unilaterally. This needs to be planned with time, if there is no alternative.

As discussed,  we are follow up with them to draw  cable through drainage line (As Airtel One),
Also Estate Office recieved complaints from Residents that the cable are hanging in thier utilities area. 
This internet provider not listening Our request  from beginning. 

We are follow up with them from 2019,
Fyki
9/6/20, 1:41 PM - +91 99808 47825: Hi Jayaram, I understand the context but my thought is, without alternative, we need to decide the timing. May be, there needs to be an alternative service provider and we cut this service off. This connection was there for last 4 years. Few people logged off as they do not need but if someone needs then we cannot pull off just like that without alternative. Anyway i know, it does not work here as we look at process here rather than outcome impact. I rest my case here.

9/6/20, 10:47 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

We would like to inform all residents that we got an email notification from villa 19 that a few of the family members have been tested CoVid +ve.  The concerned authorities are in touch with them as we write and we will come to know more about any do's and don'ts that need to be in place as required.

We want to recommend all members of the community that anyone that has interacted closely with the members of villa 19 in the last 1 week (or so), please take necessary precautions including isolation if needed. While the association will provide the necessary support to the family concerned, request all to respect the personal space and privacy of the family.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA
9/7/20, 10:09 AM - +91 99808 47825: Hi MC, just now spoke to ACT guys ( Mr Balram, Sign up team) and they are all ready to provide fibernet to JR GREENWICH immediately once they have NOC from Association. I guess he is reaching out to Jayaram already he said. Hope Jayaram is the contact to make it happen. Will work with Jayaram to get this going.
9/7/20, 10:16 AM - +91 99808 47825: I understand from Jayaram that the proposal is already with Association. They will do the underground connection too so can Association please approve this ?
9/7/20, 10:53 AM - +91 72594 37677: +1..We also request the association to kindly approve .It would be greatly helpful if ACT provides service .
9/7/20, 7:48 PM - JRSrini: Thanks Sambit. I am also looking to have an additional connection as backup. 

Request association to approve the second vendor who can be our alternative.
9/7/20, 11:19 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

We want to give you all a quick update on how our Villa 19 residents are doing.   Currently, the 3 individuals who have tested positive are in a stable condition, and we wish them a speedy recovery. A close watch is kept on the other members of the family, and necessary care is being taken.

All members of this Villa have been requested to keep themselves inside the house in isolation so that we eliminate potential exposure externally. We are in touch and will ensure any help they need is addressed. Many of you have volunteered to help and thanks to all who sent such notes.

The MC met this evening to take stock of the development and to chalk out any other areas that we need to review. As a precaution, the MC requests anyone that had any interaction with any member of the Villa 19 family to keep a close watch on their health and be in isolation for the next few days. The MC also decided to keep the facilities (park, and tennis) open as per the government guidance, but request everyone to limit their movements and practice social distancing and PROPER use of facemask. Some of the residents have raised concerns about the lack of facemasks or improper use among the residents (both kids and adults) when they are in common areas.

Request all of you to take these recommendations seriously for the sake of you and your neighbors/friends' health and wellbeing.

Please contact us if you have any questions or need clarifications...These are challenging times and request to avoid speculations of any sort and feeding the grapevine. :-)

Thank you

9/8/20, 7:59 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Dear Residents, the nodal health officer responsible for our area contacted us today (the doctor at the nearby health centre) and later got a  call from another doctor from public health. They are expected in our layout tomorrow to speak with Villa 19 family followed by testing for all residents. They strongly recommend everyone to undergo the test which is done free of charge. They  will need to bring enough number of test kits and expecting an indicative number from us.  Those who would like to undergo this test may please enter the Villa #, Name and total number of members undergoing the test in the Google sheet with link  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pleAfrc0twoTbd3xLmn1SOThd_iB7HBZz5_8Nt80c-0/edit?usp=sharing

Please complete your entries in the next 2 hours. Thanks

9/10/20, 10:41 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Good morning, the team to collect swab for testing will be reaching by 11 a.m. Jayaram will co-ordinate with all registered residents by calling them on phone. The suggestion from the collection team is for a family  of one Villa to go together to help this process. Every member needs to carry their cell phone where a registration needs to be done first before proceeding to swab collection. The swab colector will be wearing a PPE and they can stay on that for 2 hours in one go as informed...so, request the registered members to be ready to go near CH the moment Jayaram gives a call. Exact location will be notified by Jayaram...thanks

9/13/20, 7:55 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Dear Residents, during the recent RT-PCR test in JRG, a total of 72 individuals had given swab samples, which included residents from 17 Villas,  our office staff, few housekeeping staff/security staff and couple of maids.  Results started coming in since yesterday and as per rules, the association does not get this information. Based on information received from residents so far, two of them have tested +ve (1) an  additional member of Villa 19 and (2) a maid who worked in 3 villas. Our enquiries indicated that at Villa 97 and 129, this maid was restricted upto utility (externally) only, while at 23, she did chores inside the villa too with mask on.
Please note that both these new +ve cases were asymptomatic.  Please check if any of your help has  interacted with this maid and take necessary precautions as may be needed.
BTW - during this test, Villa 19 had two  -ve results too which indicates how unpredictable this virus/infection could be.  Thanks for your attention and following all precautions as advised so far.

I will do for villa 23. Considering she might be already at least 5 days positive and at least for villa 23, we are perfectly fine so far, so I will look for any info from any other villa if they see any symptom. Thank you.
9/17/20, 11:21 AM - +91 99808 47825: It has been 8 days since the test was done for the said daily help, Villa 23 folks are fine so far. Hope the other villa members are doing good too.

Just to update you all, the  Villa 19 family  members who tested positive have completed their recommended quarantine period as of 17th Sep. All of them have recovered and undergone retest on the 18th, the results have come yesterday as -ve. The treating doctor and our nodal health officer have informed them that there are no more requirements of home isolation  all the time. However, the family has volunteered to not freely interact /mingle with other community members for the next few days as a precautionary measure. We are glad that all of them have recovered and on road to get back to their normal activities. Thanks to all members of the community who supported the family during this  difficult time. 

On another note,  the maid who tested postive has completed 9 days of quarantine.  The doctor has asked her to see after 10 days.  She will do so and will update us on the advice. Thanks.

*Stay safe & stay healthy.*

*Regards,*

9/24/20, 10:43 AM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

Wanted to share an update with you from residents of Villa 19.  As you know, 4 of the residents were tested CoVid +ve a couple of weeks back.  With the support from all of you, they have kept themselves under home quarantine for 10 days (as advised by the doctors) and now they are tested CoVid -ve.

This, as all of you, would agree, is great news... but unfortunately when they got the remaining family rechecked, 2 of the individuals were tested CoVid +ve.  Due to this reason, the doctor has recommended all of the residents of the villa to re-quarantine again for additional 10 days.

This, as you can understand, puts a lot of stress on the residents of villa 19.  We would ask for your continued support to the members of the family and wishes for their speedy recovery.

At the current time, all the residents are not having any major issues/symptoms and are doing well. But having said that, the residents of the villa have confirmed that they will re-quarantine themselves (all of the residents) again as the doctor has advised.

Wish all the residents a speedy recovery and assure them all necessary support from the association and the community.

Kind regards,
MC, JRGSHOA
9/24/20, 1:56 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

Wanted to correct/clarify something in the previous message.  After re-verification with the Doctor... the members who have  tested negative recently need not be quarantined since the ones who tested +ve are being isolated. Hence isolation rules apply differently.

But having said that... the residents of villa 19  have volunteered to take all necessary precautions for the next few days while moving out or interacting with the community.  We thank them for the same and wish everything works well for them at the earliest.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

9/25/20, 9:45 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

We want to share an update with you regarding CoVid-19.  Couple of days back one of the members of villa 86 has got his CoVid test done and the results have come out today afternoon as  CoVid +ve. As a precaution, he has got admitted to a hospital  and we have news that he is doing well.

The remaining members of the villa have got a CoVid test done and their test results are awaited.  In line with the recommendation, they have isolated themselves and have asked the maids to  stop coming to their villa. The 2 maids have been asked to get the CoVid test done and report the results to the villas where they usually work.

We want to thank the residents of the villa for a quick action on the testing and also for immediately informing us of the same.  We wish the 1 person who is currently CoVid +ve a speedy recovery.

The 2 maids that come to villa 86, are known to go to villas 96, 110, and 002.  We ask the residents of these villas to take  necessary actions depending on the exposure they have had to these maids.

We will keep you all updated as and when any relevant information comes to our notice.

Thank you all, and wish everyone to be safe and healthy.
Regards,

10/19/20, 4:30 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents,

We have recently received complaint from residents regarding late night sound/noise levels.  

We would like to request everyone that noises, sounds in general or during events should not be continued  after 10PM, it has been noted that these timings are not being followed in the recent days. This requirement becomes even more critical as we know that some of us have work during US or other odd hours, and some other have kids who are studying (including taking exams) from home.

Hence, this is a reminder to all residents to considerately manage that any noise/sound  that could potentially disturb the sleep, work or study should be  stopped by 10PM.

We are sure that all residents can/should be considerate to other residents and  members of our well knit community.  So would appreciate all of your co-operation on the above.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

Demand note has been sent  for *Q2 July -Sept  2020 maintenance due*via email  and thank you if you have already paid  for your respective villa/plot.

*In case not then please make the payment as early as possible but no later than 15th November, 2020 to avoid delay charges.*

Appreciate your support by remitting the amount at earliest and avoiding further reminders/follow -ups.

Regards,
Management Committee
JR Greenwich Site and House Owners' Association
11/9/20, 6:42 AM - JRSrini: Thanks Jayaram. 

Since the short notice seem to continue, thought of giving this feedback to you & JRGA.

Deadline is too short to charge any delay charges. Not everyone will be able to do this at such a short notice, at all times.

In future, either send us the demand note in advance or at least give us 3-4 weeks of notice.

Thank you!
11/9/20, 7:37 AM - +91 98867 47040: I agree. It will be good to get at least 3-4 weeks notice.
11/9/20, 7:42 AM - +91 96861 11715: Yes I also agree

11/10/20, 2:27 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Hi Srini  & the rest who echoed this view may please note:
1. Except for the last 2 demand notes, the lead time for payment has mostly been 15 or more days, the one decided by the MC. The last 2 have been @11 days and 9 days and not a week's time which is a wrong statement in the first place.
2. Please note we have not kept a dedicated accountant to manage accounting, consolidation, tabulation and all that  leads to generation of the demand note.  Few of us invest our time side by side running our regular work. At times, it is difficult to allocate priority for a community service and if a member is too busy not to get even 5 minutes in 9-11 days for an online payment, that too for services availed/enjoyed during the past quarter, I don't think he should be getting the time to write such messages either.  
3. Sending / giving 3-4 weeks for paying maintenance is not a practical proposition. By now, every household should know that there is going to be one demand per quarter and we are talking about 4 payments in a year. The one sent on Saturday last week belongs to the previous quarter which got delayed beyond the normal norm and I take the blame for this delay. Thanks to those members who have been following up for the demand note and already paid. 
4. Finally, please note that the demand note for this quarter is yet to be generated which we plan to do sometime this month and send early December. Please plan for funds and payment sometime before 15th December. Also, to set the context right, ours is not a commercial organization but an association  of members where selected/elected members volunteer to run it as a service. It runs purely on trust and mutual co-operation and understanding. Thanks for understanding.
11/10/20, 8:04 AM - JRSrini: Thanks Gopal, for a detailed response. 

We do understand the problems highlighted and JRGA do have our cooperation.
11/10/20, 8:47 AM - OwnerRajeshJRG: 👍
11/10/20, 9:13 AM - +91 96566 20522: This message was deleted
11/10/20, 9:15 AM - +91 96566 20522: While Srini has accepted your explanation to resolve his request, I would like to express a slightly different view.

I think you failed to understand the “request”, instead, you seem to have taken it as a "blame".

Please read this again: “Deadline is too short to charge any delay charges. Not everyone will be able to do this at such a short notice, at all times.*

I completely agree and support this view. 

If the association has a financial crisis, there is nothing wrong in demanding the early payments but it gives a bad feeling to the members when they have to pay "penalties" on short notice for payment. I think that was the essence of the above request. 

Now, let me try to respond to your other messages as well:

>> The last 2 have been @11 days and 9 days and not a week's time which is a wrong statement in the first place.

I don't think anyone said "it was a week's time only". Above request from Srini simply states "short notice". And when you say "it was 9 days and not just a week", you sound like it is *a lot more than a week*. (The email came at 1:19am and even if you consider the night it arrived, it is still a bit shorter than 9 days and the difference is not large enough to claim "it is more than a week".)

>> “At times, it is difficult to allocate priority for a community service”

You don't need to allocate any extra time to give extra time to make payments :-)

>> “if a member is too busy not to get even 5 minutes in 9-11 days for an online payment, that too for services availed/enjoyed during the past quarter, I don't think he should be getting the time to write such messages either.”

This statement is not only rude, but does not make any sense as well. You sound like "making payment" is a matter of spending 5 minutes. There are various aspects to this. For example, in my case, I wanted to arrange my tenant to make the payment on behalf of me but dropped the idea since the time was too short to make it work. I went ahead and paid mine since I didn’t want to be reminded of the “community service” and “co-operation”. While 90% or even more people will be able to make the payments as soon as the notice arrives, there may be some people who need some extra time to make things happen. Nothing wrong in being considerative. 

>> “I don't think he should be getting the time to write such messages either.”  

This was a rude statement and reduces the value of the great service you are doing for the JRG community.

>> “Sending / giving 3-4 weeks for paying maintenance is not a practical proposition”

Most associations generally give 4-6 weeks time to make the payments after the invoices are generated. I don't understand what is the practical issue here. If your issue here is with “generating invoice in advance.”, you don’t have to do it that way. Instead, generate it whenever feasible but give some time for the members to make the payment. 
I would request you to consider at least 3 weeks for payment considering the practical difficulties many of us may have.

>> “I take the blame for this delay”

This is where you got it completely wrong. They were “requests” and not “blames”.

>> “the demand note for this quarter is yet to be generated which we plan to do sometime this month and send early December. Please plan for funds and payment sometime before 15th December”

That’s a confirmation that the requests for “more time” are “rejected” and will not be considered in future. 

>> “ours is not a commercial organization but an association  of members where selected/elected members volunteer to run it as a service. It runs purely on trust and mutual cooperation and understanding”

This was reminded often in this group. I request you to read your last sentence (especially the last word) once again and follow the spirit of it.

Team, you are all doing a great job in spending your personal time for the community. And the JRG community is one of the best communities in the neighbourhood because of your efforts. Please be a bit more considerate when you respond to the requests from the members and that will help in maintaining our community as the most harmonious community as well.
11/10/20, 9:45 AM - +91 97312 07112: This advise was needless and hurting the people already serving the community!
Why one cannot plan monthly and keep money aside knowing very well that have to certain amount (+_500)?
It doesn't matter whether you pay or your tenant pays. It's not big issue at all....!
No boby is perfect in this world...!
Please don't hurt people who are selflessly serving the community!
11/10/20, 9:47 AM - JrGopal128Wood: I have nothing to comment if the message is conveniently split and views expressed. Tony - you have not attended any residents' meeting nor the AGM. Please attend the next one where we can discuss more on this.
11/10/20, 9:49 AM - +91 96566 20522: Giving advice or hurting the people already serving the community was not my intention. My apologies if I hurt anyone, especially Gopal. I very well understand the efforts behind making things happen.   

But I reserve my rights to express my views.
11/10/20, 10:00 AM - +91 99808 47825: I believe, it is the amount of Maintenance we are willing to pay Vs. Experience. If we need better experience then we need to engage a third party to manage so that no one needs to put their personal time to run the community.
11/10/20, 10:01 AM - +91 96566 20522: Sure, Gopal. If there are reasons beyond what I know through the communications in Whatsapp and email, I withdraw my request for extra time. And my apologies to you if I hurt you through my message.
11/10/20, 10:13 AM - +91 96202 12548: Agree, or if an additional person needs to be hired to help Jayaram and MC then it's worth it. No matter who is on MC they will not be able to dedicate enough time to it.
11/10/20, 10:50 AM - +91 97312 07112: It's going to cost money...Lot of money!
If people are do much reluctant to pay few rupees penalty if get delayed for paying in time (10 to 15 days is not very small time for educated people like us. More importantly there should always be some limit otherwise it will be like government ITR, keep on increasing the deadline....!)
11/10/20, 10:50 AM - +91 97312 07112: so*
11/10/20, 10:53 AM - +91 97312 07112: You can comment provided you contribute...!
If you stay outside renting out your premises then comment without knowing what is ground reality that hurts....!
11/10/20, 10:54 AM - +91 97312 07112: At least attend AGM and then talk...!

11/10/20, 8:22 PM - +91 96566 20522: Sorry, I didn't know I am not allowed to comment if I don't contribute beyond what I do now.

11/11/20, 1:28 PM - +91 97312 07112: *This is just a suggestion:*
How about collecting the maintenance every month (latest by say, 10th of each month)!!
By now, we know approximate amount of maintenance for each villa, round it off to nearest figure! 
It's not a new idea,
most of the associations work this way.
As I said, it's just a suggestion, there may be some practical difficulties....!
Therefore, I leave it to the committee to decide, considering all pros and cons!
(Any Delta may between actual spent against collected amount could be adjusted quarterly or semi-annualy or annually!!)

11/22/20, 8:54 PM - +91 98863 96197: More than the repeater ( I tried Netgear) I suggest to explore the wireless Mesh option . It can extend to the floors . You can check TP link, it works well for me , but would like you to think of Power backup . If you have one for router , you will have to have them for the extenders as well.
11/22/20, 8:56 PM - JRGopalReva: I use dual band TP link repeater, and happy with it. Yes I use 20min backup too, which is of great help.
11/22/20, 9:05 PM - JRRahulTaneja: Netgear Orbi mesh router is good option

11/24/20, 2:20 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear members, 

As per request from few residents to reopen the clubhouse and considering the situation of COVID-19,  the MC members met last weekend and the conclusion was to open the Clubhouse for Gym, TT and Badminton facilities. The rest of the club house remains closed for any larger gatherings.

Request all the residents to follow these guidelines in the interest of their own health and over all health of the community...

TT and GYM facilities – Maximum of 2 persons at a time (given the size of rooms).
BADMINTON COURT -  Maximum of 4 persons at a time.
SANITIZE your hands before entering the clubhouse facility.
WEAR Masks at all times except while playing.
Please bring your own hand sanitizer and towels.
Ensure cleaning of the equipment before and after use with a wet Tissue (Sanitizer tissues) or a Wet a towel with the sanitizer.
Do not enter the clubhouse if you are having cold, cough, fever or Flu like symptoms.
Educate kids and teenagers in your family not to gather in the clubhouse as it’s an enclosed facility.
Do not entertain visitors to the clubhouse for using these facilities.

Since COVID is still spreading rapidly and Karnataka is among top affected states at the moment, we suggest avoiding doubles for some time keeping in view the proximity of partners and lack of masks. However, we leave it to the discretion and judgement of the players.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

11/25/20, 1:42 PM - JR18Jayakumar: Cyclone Nivar is on its way. It will become very severe cyclone by today evening,
accornding to IMD prediction if forecasts are going to be correct. Bangalore is going to face it with heavy rain and wind speed of 50-60 km/h.

We have only 1 day(today) for preparation.

1. Ensuring roof is cleaned and RWH pipes are not blocked.
2. Every blocks rain water drains (basement/parking) are not blocked.
3. Road outside at entry gate is higher. Outside water entering MM compound is possible. Ensuring that these water passes through rain water channel.
4. Protect sump - not to allow outside water to enter sumps.
5. Expect power-cut after cyclone is gone. Hence diesel backup may be required.

* Bangalore very rarely comes on the path of a cyclone. Hence, people may not understand the gravity and post-impact of a cyclone.

Rain forecast for Bangalore in next 3 days is ~120mm including 100mm of rain on 25th only.

The RWA groups around have invited us to join a group which will be used to submit a memorandum to the MLA and communicate any further course of action. Certainly we can not allow another situation around us like the one HSR residents have been facing for years now. So, please join the whatsapp group below and the coordinators of the group would let us know what is planned next.

12/1/20, 12:20 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,
As some of you might have heard, there is a DUMP YARD that is being considered very close out community.  This location is about 20 meters from Mana Candela apartments and along the road on the other side of JRG phase 2.  This plot is less than 1KM from our community and has the potential to cause many health hazards.
All associations in our vicinity are trying to put a request to the authorities to consider moving the proposed DUMP YARD to a location that far from residential communities.  We have attending a meeting with adjoining community associations and wanted to start with a letter to the authorities.  A copy of the letter is attached below for your reading.  To make the letter more impactful, we would like to have as many of the residents (every adult residing) sign the letter. A copy of the letter will be with Jayaram and would request each one of you to coordinate with Jayaram to sign by noon tomorrow.
We will later submit the letter to all the appropriate departments/officials so that we can stop the plans as early as possible.
As you know, the more signatures the better… and faster the better.
Thank you all,
Regards,
JRGSHOA

12/11/20, 7:00 PM - JRVinay: *(AGM2020 postponement and participation confirmation)*

Dear Association Members,

As a follow-up to the earlier communications (WhatsApp, MGM) regarding AGM2020 that is planned to be conducted on 13th December 2020, *please find the further update with important details below....*

Final account closing is still in progress, despite all our efforts and support from us,  it is getting delayed due to practical reasons/limitations which our accountant firm is having. Based on the latest discussions with our CA, accounts closing completion by Saturday, the 12th Dec, is a 50-50 chance. Considering this fact and that placing the finalized accounts for review and approval by the members during the AGM is a mandatory part of the proceedings,  *we would need to postpone the AGM2020 by one week (to new date as: 20th Dec, 2020).*

In the mean time, we request all “Owner Members (Resident/Non-Resident)” to confirm participation by Monday sending a message to our Estate Manager – Jayaram via email to  *jrg.estatemanager@gmail.com* with below details... 

*1) Villa # :*
*2) Name :*
*3) Confirmation for date 20 Dec, 2020 : YES/NO*

Confirmation by the members is mandatory for us to make necessary arrangements.
  
Upon closing of accounts, following documents will be shared for your review & response...

*1. AGM Notice/Agenda, associated annexures and other related documents*

*2. Last AGM/MGM meeting minutes (which needs ratification during the upcoming AGM)*

Please mark your calendars for the dates below:

*1) By 14th Dec 2020 : Confirm your attendance to AGM*

*2) 20th Dec 2020 (@8.30am) : AGM date*

*Also request to keep an eye for communication with further updates about AGM2020.* 

Appreciate your support and cooperation!

Co-WIN (COVID-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network) is an upgraded version of the eVIN (Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network), and available to download for free on the Play Store. In the first two stages, the government will vaccinate priority groups including frontline workers and emergency workers. People with co-morbidities will get the jab in the third stage. For this, a self-registration process will be required through the Co-WIN app.

To ensure smooth tracking and registration for COVID-19 vaccine, the Co-WIN app is divided into five modules for administrator, registration, vaccination, beneficiary acknowledgement and reports. Once people will start to register for the app, the platform will upload bulk data on co-morbidity provide by the local authorities.

1/9/21, 7:30 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents,

There have been a few recent incidents brought to association’s notice around car parking.

Pls note the recommendation from association around car parking:

1) Pls park you car in your villa’s designated car parking area.

2) Any additional vehicle  should be parked “only” in designated common parking area.

3) Avoid parking on the side streets/crosses as they are narrower.

4) In case car is parked on the road/street (even momentarily), pls ensure it is done in a manner that allows large vehicles including delivery vehicles etc to pass by without issues.

In general, as responsible residents of the community, pls ensure that your vehicle parking does not cause any inconvenience to others when they try to manoeuvre their vehicles.

Thanks for the support.

1/21/21, 5:18 PM - JrAditya: *Important : Cleaning of UG Sump, OHT etc.*

Dear residents,

Keeping in mind the water scarcity and avoiding any water wastage during summer months, the Mgmt Committee has decided that *not to* allow any sump, OHT cleaning as for individual villa between March 1st, 2021 till June 30, 2021 (4 Months).
 
So residents should plan for sump-OHT cleaning etc. before February 28, 2021.

It is advisable to do this activity an evening before the scheduled weekly water release day.

*Best case*  - Plan this cleaning on Tuesday evening. 

Step 1 - Get the OHT filled up in the morning on Tuesday. 
Step 2 - Now power off the sump motor.  The water pumped in the OHT will be consumed during the day.
Step 3 - Clean the OHT first in the evening. 
Step 4 - Now pump the water up into the OHT.
Step 5 - Clean the sump

Wednesday morning is one of the weekly water release day. so you will get sump filled up the on Wednesday morning. 

Avoid sump/OHT cleaning on any other days as it is not possible to release water on individual requests arbitrarily. 

Water release schedule - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday. 

Cooperation from all residents requested.

Treat this as a sincere request to act in time.

1/22/21, 6:57 AM - +91 74063 33000: That's great guidance !! We did sump cleaning couple of weeks back. We closed the sump water knob and waited for water to get consumed. Believe or not sump water lasted 7 days for us. May be our consumption is less but this shows how much water gets wasted during cleaning.
1/22/21, 9:37 AM - +91 98801 52162: Any pointers to a good Orthopedic nearby?

Out of 1800 submissions towards bonsai exhibition at South Asia level, they were chosen in the top 150 to exhibit their bonsai. Once things normalise, I highly recommend taking a tour of their terrace and outdoors to see their passion. Sharing the pic of their exhibit which was selected. Thought to share here so that you all know of the great talent that we have among us. 👇

Residents - Our day electrician, Abhijit is on leave starting today and will return in mid-March. We had planned a temporary replacement who unfortunately met with accident couple of days ago and isn't available anymore. As a result, we have got another person who should start from tomorrow. Please note that this may delay closure of tasks requiring electrician. Also, please anticipate higher turnaround time from new person as it will take him time to understand how things work here. Please continue to raise your tickets via MyGate and contact Mr Jayaram if you have any questions. Thanks for your understanding and patience.

3/7/21, 2:45 PM - JRThyagaraj111: Hi A tremor noise  today early morning 1 AM  which is an initiation to the party in JR and went on till 4 AM which is not tolerable anymore, which woke up people who were in sound sleep around. The source of the disturbance was from 5th cross Wipro side witnessed by even association member. Inspite of being warned by Security nd Police personnel   the loud noises continued for few more hours.
 In spite of many personnel requests & warnings from association/neighborhood, these parties/loud noises in the night are repeating by people who show no remorse to their behavior. There are specific places for these kind of celebrations/shouting/screaming/loud music but not residential premises. Most of us just curse them for disturbing us and go back to sleep or sleepless over the night or call the security which will not have any effect on them. We can also see the futile attempt by association towards this issue. We can't continue to live like this anymore. 
Loud noise after 10:00 P.M is against law, some of our own educated residents who are responsible citizen/parents/neighbors are breaking the rules repeatedly. Its no joke. We have to think about what we are passing to the next generation as responsible parents.
Events like new year or community celebrations are exceptions which happens once a year but they do have minimal disturbance to the community after 10:00 PM when rest of the nature is sound. But partying every week is really not tolerable. Every day every family has some or the other reasons to celebrate and possible to bring  friends and party the whole night/burst crackers/balloons/bang doors/scream/laugh/honk/break glasses etc etc  waking up the whole community nd other neighboring communities too. Do you expect this reaction as a solution? or can we stop these kind of thoughtless, senseless and  mindless  behaviors and maintain  peace / harmony in the community.
3/8/21, 8:51 AM - +91 97418 32223: Dear Resident - Unfortunate to hear about this incident. MC has taken note of this and a small group of MC members will reach out to you to discuss and resolve this issue. Also, a gentle reminder to all the residents that per bye law, we request you all to exercise care with activities so as not to disturb the peace and which cause disturbance to others. Sound system and other noises that can disturb your neighbors should be stopped by 10 PM. Thanks.

3/9/21, 8:01 PM - +91 97318 77400: As an obective observer, without really knowing what happened, I do wish you hadn't said "We have to think about what we are passing to the next generation as responsible parents". 

As such there is enough moral policing going on in our community, but commenting on anybody's role as a parent, is an inexcusable crossing of a line, IMHO.

The above link now contains the _"guidelines and procedure for reporting complaints"_. It has a clearly spelt out escalation path that all of us should respect and follow. The same document is attached below for easier access.

MC of JRG Society
3/21/21, 10:15 PM - JrAditya: No, "organized classes in big organized groups" are yet to restart.

However if one-to-one sessions are there, it is left to a person's choice and ability.

The facilities are not yet open for "scheduled sessions for coaching".

The risk of COVID-19 continues to be present and the indicators outside do not allow us to open the organized coaching to commence anytime soon.

3/25/21, 10:36 PM - +91 96638 49641: In the wake of the rise in the number of coronavirus cases in the last couple of weeks, JRG Cultural Subcom has decided to not organize community Holi event this year.

Covid-19 has once again taken the color out of Holi festival, but not the spirits. We'll come out stronger and more colorful, once this pandemic is behind us. 

~JRG Cultural Subcom
3/27/21, 2:25 PM - +91 97418 32223: *Important message from MC, JRGSHOA*

Dear Residents, we're sure you all are following the daily increase in COVID cases and it clearly appears that we are marching towards another crest. Bangalore is seeing a daily uptick and we have learned about few positive cases reported in Kodathi gate. As a result, MC members reviewed and felt the need to reiterate the following:

*1.	Wearing of masks while stepping out of your villa*: Keeping exceptions (like running, small kids) aside, we would like to make this a mandatory requirement. Kids should wear masks in the park area too.

*2.	Inform association if you/family/friend is/are arriving from a travel and need(s) to undergo quarantine*: Please note that it is mandatory to inform association at jrgassociation@gmail.com

3. We've learned that panchayat office reported an infected staff and hence suggest avoiding visiting their office for sometime.

4. Last and probably the most important thing – *please do not organize group celebration/procession this Holi*. Our vibrant community has seen amazing Holi celebration in the past and we’re sure we will get many more occasions to repeat the same, but not this year. 

We wish you all a safe and happy Holi. Should you’ve any questions, please drop an email to association email address.

Value of homemaker’s work same as hubby’s at office: SC.
 http://toi.in/X0wocY36/a31gj

She was a "housewife". When she died in a scooter accident along with her husband, the insurance company calculated compensation only based on the husband's income. But the court would not accept it.

Instead, the court stated that a homemaker's work contributes, "In a very real way to the economic condition of the family, and the economy of the nation, regardless of the fact that it may have been traditionally excluded from economic analyses. It is a reflection of changing attitudes and mindsets and of our international law obligations. Most importantly, it is a step towards the constitutional vision of social equality and ensuring dignity of life to all individuals.” 

Bench of Justices N V Ramana and Surya Kant, thank you. I hope this marks a major new change.

4/23/21, 7:57 PM - +91 97418 32223: *COVID-19 Positive Case Alert*

Dear Residents – 

We would like to inform you all that we were informed by villa # 22 that a family member has tested COVID +ve. We will work with them and concerned authorities to ensure that required do’s and don’ts are followed.

We recommend that if anyone has interacted closely with members of villa 22 in last 1 week, please take necessary precautions including isolation if needed. The association will take steps to sanitize necessary common areas.

While the association will provide the necessary support to the family concerned, request all to respect the personal space and privacy of the family.

MC, JRGSHOA
4/23/21, 8:33 PM - +91 90080 60684: Hi Kunal, it is very important that we find out if any house with COVID positive had some visiting help. It is very important that we ask any visiting help to quarantine themselves and also trace if the visiting helps were working in any other houses and those houses should also go into quarantine
4/23/21, 9:44 PM - +91 91487 35765: Hi,...One of our family members has tested positive and we have received the reports today at 7.30pm,....
We have proactively informed  MC, Manager and House maid and asked her to take the test,....
She was only working at our place as she was on leave in the other villa from past 20 days,...
We are taking the test for all the family members tomorrow,....
Thank you to Kunal for reaching out immediately,...
Kunal and Jayram have taken all the details,....
Thank you for the support of MC,Jayaram.
4/23/21, 9:55 PM - +91 97418 32223: Sure Sonic. And for the benefit of residents, we take few immediate actions:
1. Any help/maid who visits the impacted villa is informed to isolate and we allow them inside only after they complete mandatory isolation or show negative results. We are enforcing the latter.
2. Inform security to inform visitors/delivery folks about the impacted villa so that they exercise more caution
3. Inform impacted villa about waste collection procedure and deliver waste bags meant for that purpose
4. Inform residents about the impacted villa so that they can exercise necessary care

Last, office bearers are trying to stay in regular touch with impacted villa to ensure that they get our support and at the same time we ensure safety of all the residents
4/23/21, 9:56 PM - +91 97418 32223: *Update on COVID positive cases in JR Greenwich*

Residents - Since April 7, when we first informed about Covid positive case in JRG this year with villa 70, we've had two more families reporting positive cases - 164 on April 21 and now villa 22. Additionally, we know atleast one maid Aasma who worked in multiple villas reported positive last week. 

Association is in touch with all these villa members and thankfully they haven't shown very strong symptoms. We pray for their speedy recovery.

Infact villa 70 members are doing very good, they observed the full 14 days of quarantine after onset of symptoms and extended their isolation further by a week. They submitted their test on Apr-18 in Kodathi PHC and are awaiting results. Most likely it may be negative.

Stay safe, exercise Covid appropriate behavior and take care!
4/23/21, 9:58 PM - +91 98105 83337: Thanks Kunal for the updates. Wishing everyone a speedy recovery. Please do let us know if we can contribute in any way to support the families, other residents and staff. Let's stay strong...
4/23/21, 10:13 PM - +91 90080 60684: Thanks Kunal and all the office bearers

4/23/21, 10:44 PM - JrAditya: Hi all,

The COVID numbers inside JRG are growing. It's time to enforce some strict and straight discipline.

The MC suggests we:

1. Close any and all possible places where people gather. This includes parks, futsall, basketball and tennis court. This anyway is suggested by Govt. too. That's a small sacrifice we all can make instead of a collective misery.

2. Tell people to postpone all possible ventures outside of JRG. Self discipline has to be enforced. JRG MC can not make house arrests but it's the people to question themselves.

3. Should not stop maids and home deliveries, but advise all residents to ask maids to wear masks at all times. Use sanitizers liberally.

4. Masks should be worn at all times when stepping outside. This is MANDATORY, and is strictly to be forces by the security. ALL have to follow, and that includes all age groups. Security will be asked to clearly enforce this and report the deviations to MC. Encourage the grown up kids to respect others and wear the masks - always and correctly.

5. Any travellers into JRG (friends and relatives) should be seen with utmost caution. MC should be notified via email, and proper entry and exit at security gate is expected. This helps in contact tracing.

6. No construction activity will be allowed over the weekend, as per govt. guidelines on weekend curfew. Labor and workers should be advised accordingly. Any request for deviation will be denied prima facie.


All these guidelines are for the collective safety and with immediate effect.

In your service,
JRG Management Committee

I'm Medhansh Garg of Villa 71
As you all know COVID cases have been steadily increasing in JRG.
To help the fellow residents, who are infected in their tough times, I have come up with a *“Meal Train”* to help them get their daily three meals from volunteer residents from JRG.

I request all fit people to volunteer for this cause and all COVID infected residents to sign up to receive this help.

I will attach a sheet for people who require the service and people who are willing to volunteer.

Thankyou and I wish the affected residents a speedy recovery.

5/20/22, 12:33 PM - +91 98455 35339: Our Villa (31) is available for rent from August. It's  4bhk+servant room. If any of your acquaintances are looking for one, kindly share my number with them
5/20/22, 2:28 PM - JRVenu: For Villa’s where there were multiple responses, ONLY the Last response (time based) response were considered. For Villa where both Owner & tenant have responded, we will ONLY take Owner’s Response.
Overall Count of Responses:
-	Total # of Responses – 88
-	# of Villa with Unique Responses – 77
-	Of the 77 responses… 72 are owners and 5 are tenants

Considering Both Owners & Tenants the responses are Below:
- Primary Response to the Yes/No question (Total = 75), 52 opted for heating pool and 25 for not having heated pool
- For those who voted YES (Total = 52)
i.	Solar Heating – 23
ii.	Electric Heating – 16
iii.	Either – 12
iv.	Neither – 1

So, the majority seems to be towards solar option.  Which we will have to investigate further and find the optimal solution balance between performance vs financials.  Few of the MC members will continue working on this and keep us posted on the progress.
5/20/22, 2:30 PM - DrArunJR: Thank you so much
5/20/22, 2:31 PM - DrArunJR: Just a last question on this topic- are we also considering the option of heated pool for 6-7 months.

5/24/22, 6:45 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

As you all know by now, we are building a PERMANENT wall on the east side of the campus next to back gate.

We have started removing sections of walls as part of the wall building process, and to cover the security exposure we have put permanently stationed security guards at the opened sections.

One other potential issue is that the removal of wall and exposure to the site behind us could cause any SNAKES residing in the area to start moving out/dispersing.  We have asked the security guards to stay vigilant and divert any SNAKES out away from our campus.  But it is important for us (residents) to stay cautious and *limit any kids playing in the area and adults (with or without pets) walking in the area (around 7th and 6th cross)*.

Please exercise extra caution for the next few weeks when moving in the area.  For all villas in the area, it goes without saying that please be careful and limit your movements accordingly.

Thank you all, and stay safe.

Venu Reddy on behalf of MC, JRGSHOA

This rule surely needs a revisit and i hope we all agree for this amendment in rules. We had higher spread of covid earlier and this kind of precaution made sense during that time. Presently, covid virus spread is negligible even via direct humans (present bbmp statistics shows that). In present circumstances, do we really think that  watering the gardens using stp water can spread covid? Also if such is a case, why not just leave that villa garden and water all rest of them. 

Is there a subcommittee group where we can ask mc members to change this "law" considering present circumstances?

5/28/22, 3:08 PM - JRRahulTaneja: Yes, can we increase the watering frequency, for us he only comes max 2 times a week.
It's better to reuse stp water in gardens, rather than normal water supply

They are just  few meters away.

We wanted to let you know that we have a mild CoVid +ve case in villa 22.  The family has started following the CoVid protocols and keeping themselves isolated.
The incident does not seem serious, but in the interest of community safety we recommend that you take necessary precautions.

As requested before… please mask-up and maintain social distancing as much as possible.
We wish speedy recovery for all that have been impacted, will support them as needed.

As you may have noticed we have started painting and maintenance works for all Electric Junction Boxes across JRG. While the painting works are on, houses in the vicinity may face some disturbance due to noise and labour movement.

We have an additional request, the paint sprayed will need a few hours to dry, we request you to be vigilant and ensure children do not touch or play near these.

Appreciate the understanding and co-operation.

Kind Regards,

6/5/22, 1:12 PM - JrPrashanth47: @917022317048 - Dry waste from my villa is not getting picked up. This is the 3rd day Hasiduralla guys are missing. Can you please inform them?
6/6/22, 2:27 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents and Owners,

I wanted to reach out you as a MC lead for Security Sub-Committee. I wanted to see if we can get a few volunteers as part of the team so that we can get a few things moving.

My request is that we try for a good representation across all crosses.  We have Palkesh from 1st/2nd Cross, need 1 person from 3rd/4th cross, need 1 person from 5th/6th/7th cross, and 1 more (we currently have Kunal-150 as one member) volunteer from 2nd phase.

I am hoping we can start with working on the following:
-	Review the security routine and personnel needs
-	Review reporting in MyGate for security and all housekeeping staff.  Automate it for administration and finance activities
-	Update primary resident/owner info and clean-up mygate
-	Others that MC or residents identify, and we can prioritize

Please let message me directly on your interest to join the team.

Regards,
Security Sub-committee
6/7/22, 6:54 AM - JRHimanshu: Hi Venu,
Good Morning
I can spare some time. But I m from 2nd cross 😉.
6/7/22, 8:01 AM - JRVenu: Thanks Himansu... that is great... will add you to the team
6/7/22, 12:02 PM - JRNidhi: Dear Residents,

Hope everyone is doing well and staying healthy.

In light of the continued cases of delayed maintenance payments from many of the owners and residents, the MC has decided that the following steps will be taken moving forward.

1.	2 weeks duration will be given for all demand notes
2.	5 days before the due date a reminder will be sent by the Estate manager
3.	2 days after the due date, the villas numbers that are still pending will be put in the clubhouse notice board.  This list will be updated on a daily basis to reflect the payments being made.
4.	1 week after the due date, all outstanding maintenance will attract a penalty of 1.5% per month computed from due date of payment.
5.	Club house and common amenities access would be restricted 1 month after the payment due date. Housekeeping activities would also stop for the defaulting villas. We will obviously take into account non payment of maintenance for NOCs, move-in , move-out and rentals

The above steps will be put in place starting from the next demand note that is expected in mid July 2022. As communicated earlier, the demand notes would be shared around 15th of the first month every quarter

If you have any questions or clarifications on the above points, please reach out to any of the MC members so that we can address them at the earliest.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA
6/7/22, 8:58 PM - JRRahulTaneja: Is the back Gate for phase 3 a thorough fare now ? I see gate is always open, used by all sort of traffic and no security guard at the gates ?
6/7/22, 9:52 PM - JRVenu: Rahul... thank you for the note.  In reality it should not be open or be used or kept open as it becomes a security issue.  One of the security sub-comm members will try to reach out to you to get some details like time/date when you saw it open and who was using it.  This helps in out discussion with the security team of Phase 3.  Thank you again...

Hi,

For parents of DPS East children:

Some of us decided to do car-pooling to drop and pick children from DPS using external *driver* services.

We have one seat available in the car. If you want to join this car-pool arrangement, DM me.

6/14/22, 8:02 AM - DrArunJR: Requesting someone from MC to update on this. This seems a major change in park
6/14/22, 8:19 AM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

As informed earlier by JR Housing, there is a pylon being erected next to the park by our main gate. It is being done in-order to deviate the proposed HT line passing across our main park and to align it along the western boundary.

This is done by KPTCL approved super grade contractor under the supervision of JR Housing civil team.

As this pylon will be needing a solid foundation, a working space of 8m x 8m is provided by temporarily fencing the said area  until completion of the work.  

Until this foundation work is completed, a small section of the jogging track will not be accessible.

JR Housing has said that they will create a temporary walking path around the barricaded area to ensure that the residents walking routine is not disturbed. 

Once the pylon work is completed, the walking track will be restored in its current state.

We expect the full work to be completed within 4-6 weeks from the start of the excavation and we apologize for the inconvenience during this period.

On behalf of JRGSHOA and JR Housing

Hello team Ardour,  thank you so much for taking up this cause which is very close to my heart..🙏🏼

I am a regular and satisfied customer of re-store for the last few years. Believe me you can get some of the trendiest clothes here 😀

Understanding  the havoc dumped used clothes are making on the ecology  made me break the barrier  of using pre-loved clothes  🙂

Many of our households  are already using 'hand me down' clothes  from generations  within the family. Re-store is taking it to the next level :)

Hope to see you there on Sunday!

You might be in a rush but this speed is not excusable. 
Please 🙏

The experience was enriching at so many levels.

Witnessing the transition in children from the hesitation of using/selling pre-loved clothes to finally buying them was simply amazing...

Their energy in helping people to choose the clothes, search for their favorite colors, listen to the stories that unfolded on the way was infectious.

Blessed to be part of such a community 😊

7/26/22, 10:05 PM - +91 99808 47825: Hi MC, Water is out of sump for 23 and it is repeated now that we do not get our sump filled most of the time. Now calling out Bala Reddy, he is not responding and disconnecting calls and no one else is reachable like Jayaram n team. So does it mean, we are at the mercy of Bala Reddy ?
7/26/22, 10:09 PM - +91 99808 47825: I strongly propose to have fall back and coverage for Bala Reddy as he is single man army and it cannot work like this from a coverage perspective.
7/26/22, 10:19 PM - JRVenu: I have left a message for both Jayaram and Abijit.... will ask them to prioritize this and get this addressed early tomorrow morning
7/26/22, 10:19 PM - JRVenu: Will follow-up with Jayaram on the root cause...
7/26/22, 10:33 PM - +91 98805 00667: Riot cause - this has been discussed a few times. All villas closer to wipro wall gets lesser water filled in sump as compared to villas closer to water tank, in the same amount of time - this is due to water pressure and design of distribution pipe. Bala reddy is aware of this and genrally takes care of this by controlling the flow
7/26/22, 10:36 PM - JRVenu: Agree... maybe Jayaram can talk to other villas complexes and see if there is some way they are addressing this.  Let's see if he can find a long term solution.
7/26/22, 10:40 PM - JRRahulTaneja: Water flow is slow for us as well, as the road is sloping up as it reaches us. We should have a pump mechanism of possible
7/26/22, 10:43 PM - +91 99808 47825: I guess we all are aware of it and it was agreed with Mr Bala Reddy that he would check few times but he cares less. Last week it happened to us after one day of release and he came to say it was not released for much time. So this is not working.
7/26/22, 10:45 PM - +91 99808 47825: Just a thought why Security can't be trained on this as backup, if possible. We need coverage for emergency and I have a whole family without water till morning.
7/27/22, 9:52 AM - +91 96118 08899: Gentle reminder : incase anyone has missed , will close it by noon .
7/27/22, 10:29 AM - +91 96118 08899: Thanks for the overwhelming response 🙏 ...closing it for now .
7/27/22, 10:41 AM - +91 98802 06248: Dear Residents,

8/8/22, 7:28 AM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

One of the issues we are facing when it rains at JRG, is the rainwater from the terrace of many villas is getting into the Sewage system.  This is putting a lot of stress on the STP infrastructure both power and the material that is being consumed for the treatment process.

We have instructed Avijit to go to each villa to investigate if the terrace water from the villa is going into the sewage system.  He will be doing that by each cross starting with the 1st cross and working his way down.

We request all residents to cooperate with Avijit on this activity including giving him a few (2-3 buckets of water per villa) to perform this investigation.  If you are not available on the specific dates, please reach out to Jayaram or Avijit to coordinate as needed.

Schedule: We are expecting the work to start from today (8th Aug) and be complete by 24th Aug.

Thank you all for your support on this resource and financial saving exercise.

8/8/22, 5:17 PM - JRVenu: Hi Neighbours and Friends,

I wanted to let you all know that Deependra (our security supervisor) has reached out to us on some medical issues he is facing and requires a surgery.  Unfortunately, his employment with the security company does not cover this procedure, and Deependra was wondering if we can help him out financially.

It is estimated that he needs INR 50,000 for this procedure.  We wanted to see if the community could contribute towards this human cause by transferring the desired amount to my (Venu) GPay/PhonePe number +91 8105152164.  I will collect the amount and hand it over to Deependra at the earliest.

PS: Request anyone who can contribute to transfer the amount by EoD Wed 10th Aug.  Also, please whatsapp me once you have made the transfer with amount and villa number.

Thank you everyone for all the support, and on behalf of Deepender I would like to thank you for the support all ahead of time.

Regards,
Venu, Villa 129
8/8/22, 5:34 PM - +91 96062 66933: Would also like to review and help on medical front.

I would be happy to talk to him and guide him accordingly. 
Can you please ask him to meet me tomorrow morning. Hope I will be able to help him. 
Good night
8/9/22, 7:39 AM - JRVenu: Since he is not getting any relief from meds given his doctor has suggested him to get the procedure done. Hence the request from Deependra. Will ask him to talk to you and have a discussion.

8/9/22, 8:12 PM - +91 98802 06248: Dear Residents,

We wanted to let you know that we have a new CoVid +ve case in Villa #99 .  The family has been advised to start following established protocols and keeping themselves isolated. In the interest of community safety we recommend that each one of you take necessary precautions.

With the given rise in case we request you to please mask-up and maintain social distancing as much as possible.
We wish speedy recovery for all that have been impacted, will support them as needed.

Regards,
8/10/22, 12:09 PM - JRVenu: Dear Neighbours,

Thank you everyone for the contributions that we got until now.  We have collected INR 35,000 for Deependar as of this morning. We understand that Deependar is going ahead with the procedure and be getting it done in Lucknow where he will have the family to support him.  

From our experience I am sure that a procedure like this will need some level of hospitalization and medicines for recovery. So, we anticipate the expenses will go lot higher than INR 50K and maybe even reaching as high as INR 1 Lakh.

He is leaving Bangalore tomorrow morning, and I would like to see if we can collect as much as possible by End Of Day TODAY.  This will financially be supporting someone that has been serving our community for a long time and I personally believe is a worthy cause.

Thank you all for your kind contributions and support.

8/12/22, 10:19 AM - JRVenu: Dear Neighbours,

Wanted to update you on the contributions and status of Deependra.

We have collected INR 75K for his medical expenses.  Thank you so much for all the folks that have contributed and the kindness you have shown.

Yesterday, I have transferred INR 40K to Deependra and I will be keeping the remaining amount to be shared with him at the point of hospital discharge and medicine purchase.  Thought that money flowing to him as needed will help him manage the expenses.

The procedure is expected (as of now) to be done on Sunday and at that point we will also have a view of number days he will be staying the hospital and any other expenses he will be seeing.  I shall keep you guys posted on the same.

Some of you were asking for a pic of Deependra just so that you can relate to the person who you are contributing to.  I will send his pic right after this message so that you are aware.

Thank you all for the kind support and contributions… will keep you posted.

Regards,
Venu

8/16/22, 3:56 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

Wanted to drop you all a quick update message on the medical condition of Deependra.

First things first… The surgical procedure was done on Sunday and the operation was successful.  Deependra is now discharged and back home resting.  I have shared INR 60K for his surgery and hospital expenses from our side.  In addition to this, I have also paid for airfare (Bangalore to Lucknow) of INR 7,100… I am keeping aside similar amount for his return flight.

We have collected a total of INR 89,500 for Deependra’s expenses and after the initial set of expenses we have approx. INR 15,000 left for his medicines and related expenses.

On behalf of Deependra… thank you everyone for the generous contribution.

Regards,
Venu

8/18/22, 5:11 PM - JrAditya: *Urgent Attention Needed:*

Registrations are really low so far (only 59 till last night) and Decathlon has expressed great concern on this. It can lead to losing the sponsorship of Rs. 20,000 if the registration count does not reach 250+ by tomorrow evening 5pm.

Hence *Team Ardour* of social volunteers will be facilitating the registrations. So please welcome them when they approach you tonight or tomorrow. Fortunately it's janmashtami holiday so some of us might have time (just 5mins needed).

Volunteers of Team Ardour will make your registration process simpler. Just be ready with your phone and email box, because OTPs would come there.
8/18/22, 5:14 PM - JrSashidhar: It allows 1 primary and 1 additonal attendee per registration.  How do we get to 250
8/18/22, 5:14 PM - +91 90667 05125: Do they count junior as additional count?
8/18/22, 5:15 PM - +91 98802 06248: *Grand Sri Krishna Janmashtami*

8/18/22, 5:17 PM - +91 97405 83964: Aditya, We already did 1+1 + 2 minors. It seems it is not counting minors.
8/18/22, 5:27 PM - JrAditya: You can juniors to your profile... I had explained earlier. Now this is where Team Ardour will do their trick!!

How to get 250:
60+ families x 4 members/family
8/18/22, 5:28 PM - JrAditya: Yes
8/18/22, 5:37 PM - JrAditya: With good apartments getting only Rs. 6,000 sponsorship we had to commit a good number of registrations and support to get Rs. 20K sponsorship.
8/18/22, 5:48 PM - JrAditya: I rechecked with Decathlon store.
All juniors are also counted in as separate

The problem could be that after creating the "profile"(step-1), the people may not have "registered" to the event (step-2). And then is "check-in" to the event (step-3).

Both the teams are really charged-up and doing even the strategy planning (whom to ball what and where to ball etc) !

We have some mind-boggling hitters and some really fast-pace seamers.
Don’t miss this once a life-time opportunity ! Come join tomorrow morning !
May the best team wins ! 🏆🏆

8/26/22, 1:48 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents

There is no  3 phase Bescom power supply to STP panel from Main gate transformer LT panel. Due to this  STP  is not working.
This might be due to a cable damage near pylon construction .
Due to this we are operating DG manually while we try to find and fix cable issue.

Kindly note that there will be a delay in switching  DG on/off till this issue is fixed.
Please co-operate .
Thanks
8/26/22, 1:50 PM - JRSudhakar: Thanks

8/27/22, 6:25 AM - +91 98801 52162: Hi All, driving from sarjapur road into our approach road pls be careful. They have dug in 2-3  places along the left side which has left holes in the road. Yesterday my car tyre got stuck in one of those holes and it went right in and was quite a task to get it out. Please be careful especially in the night

8/27/22, 7:04 AM - +91 96631 79337: It's working for us
8/27/22, 7:04 AM - +91 96631 79337: You can try restarting once
8/27/22, 1:47 PM - +91 96633 05410: The gates towards phase 4/miami are locked. Is anyone aware as to why they are locked?
8/27/22, 1:55 PM - +91 96638 49641: Someone mentioned an accident happened that side.  Information not verified though.
8/27/22, 1:56 PM - +91 96633 05410: Ohk. Thanks !
8/28/22, 10:21 AM - +91 96631 79336: Is Act working?
8/28/22, 10:33 AM - DrArunJR: It seems that Act is Acting out a lot these days 🤔
8/28/22, 10:37 AM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Is act acting? 😀
8/28/22, 1:54 PM - +91 86609 99622: Did anyone availed this service? I had given all my details and have been chasing these folks but no response so far.
8/28/22, 1:58 PM - +91 96633 05410: @MC members - Any official update on why the gates towards phase 4 are locked, and any expectation as to when it will be resolved? Looks like some property dispute.

Blocking of this road will be a lot of inconvenience. Any update will be appreciated.
8/28/22, 2:39 PM - +91 77953 59366: Many school buses are using this route so it might be a big pblm from tomorrow
8/28/22, 3:18 PM - +91 97319 00776: Any issue in backup. ??
8/28/22, 3:18 PM - +91 99808 47825: Is the power down ? No gen too
8/28/22, 3:20 PM - Bhagavan: Even for me too
8/28/22, 3:21 PM - +91 97319 00776: I can also see some outsiders wandering inside layout facilities n park. 
Not sure how they allowed /entered.
8/28/22, 3:40 PM - +91 90667 05125: I will be available 5-6 PM today near Amphitheater and later 6-7 PM at villa#58 to distribute the remaining medals for sports day.
8/28/22, 4:40 PM - +91 99808 47825: Not sure if it is for few or community wide..for last 2 hours,  it is continuous on / off for main electricity and no DG backup. Anything getting worked out ?
8/28/22, 4:49 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents , 
We are operating DG manually for last two days.
It will take time ( 5 to 20 minutes)to reach DG near STP to switch on / off DG.
Meanwhile we are fixing the cable issue today EOD.
Thanks

8/28/22, 8:15 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

I wanted to share an info/update with you regarding the road leading from Phase 3 to the back road to DSMAX/Trifecta/Miami store.  The 2 gates after phase 3 are guarding a private property of the owner who has not sold/surrendered the road to the BDA.  The owner of the plot has decided to close it for reasons not known to us and since it is a private property, we do not have way to pressurize them until BDA acquires it or until the said land is given up for development.

Having said that… the walking path is still open, and individuals can walk to Miami store (as an example) if needed.

JR Housing has discussed the matter with concerned landowners to provide controlled (for specific timings) access to school buses. Which means that the owner has agreed to keep the gates open between 7:00 AM to 8.30 AM and 3:00 PM to 4.30 PM.

This is for your information so that you can notify the appropriate school buses and delivery folks as needed.

Regards,
MC JRGSHOA
8/28/22, 8:38 PM - JRHimanshu: In the afternoon can we request for 2:30 or 2:45 PM. 🙏🏻
8/28/22, 8:40 PM - JRRahulTaneja: +1 .... Hope it's for our cars as well

8/29/22, 9:50 AM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Not expected from IT company like Wipro
8/29/22, 9:51 AM - +91 96202 12548: Is it Wipro's apathy that it's like this or is it the local authoritie's?
8/29/22, 9:51 AM - +91 78996 46443: This needs a way to flow to the lake supposedly next to the road which does not happen today.
8/29/22, 9:54 AM - +91 95351 88288: <Media omitted>
8/29/22, 9:54 AM - JRGopalReva: And the other road is blocked by land owner
8/29/22, 9:56 AM - +91 95351 88288: Rain has stopped but waterflow from Wipro has not.. 

Our old story to our kids is coming true.. " hamare zamane mein hum Nadiya par karke school jaaya karte the."
8/29/22, 9:56 AM - +91 99459 37777: It had never been this bad.. we took a chance and came a quarter down towards JRG only to stop on the plot (which withholds access to the lake)
8/29/22, 9:57 AM - +91 98801 52162: Communities on this road are soon becoming Al la Rainbow Drive
8/29/22, 9:57 AM - JRGopalReva: Let's build a flyover😃
8/29/22, 9:58 AM - +91 98801 52162: It is the natural gradient of terrain.. local authorities should do something.. and for them to do something may be we need to do a dharna
8/29/22, 9:59 AM - +91 98801 52162: Exactly..
8/29/22, 9:59 AM - +91 98451 90653: Yes let’s (JR/Ahad/civil authorities etc) build a bridge and let the water connection be maintained from Wipro to the lake ?
8/29/22, 10:08 AM - +91 99809 91057: Read that after dharna RBD layout residents were penalized for encroaching rajakaluve...so dharna doesn't work
8/29/22, 10:09 AM - +91 98801 52162: We will pay for our karma ultimately
8/29/22, 10:15 AM - +91 93413 15160: Presently it is open 
We took phase 3 route only
8/29/22, 10:15 AM - JRHimanshu: Approach gate from Ph3 is open for a while. I think considering this flooding
8/29/22, 10:21 AM - +91 98863 96197: We may need to revisit making the backgate as the main gate  ? The issue is with school busses etc.
8/29/22, 10:28 AM - +91 99303 93232: <Media omitted>
8/29/22, 10:28 AM - +91 99303 93232: Pls don't take ahad euphoria road
8/29/22, 10:28 AM - +91 99303 93232: Even SUVs are not able to go
8/29/22, 10:32 AM - +91 98802 82111: Our back gate is unoperational, main gate becomes unoperational every time it rains... Not everybody can take a detour to phase 3/4 gate to enter especially the medicine or other delivery persons... So what is the solution?
8/29/22, 10:34 AM - +91 98802 82111: And i think we don't expect the maids/delivery agents to wade through water to reach JRG!!!
8/29/22, 10:34 AM - +91 98801 52162: I think proper gutters on both sides of the approach road with periodic declogging done would address the problem largely
8/29/22, 10:36 AM - +91 98801 52162: Today on the wipro side there is no gutter and one on the other side is not sufficient by itself
8/29/22, 10:37 AM - +91 98801 52162: But this is only my arm chair speculation.. i am sure there are plenty other folks here with better information into this matter and who are involved at a deeper level
8/29/22, 10:38 AM - +91 98801 52162: But we are indeed in a grim situation.. need to do something about this!
8/29/22, 10:55 AM - JRGopalReva: seems some schools are sending kids early today.
8/29/22, 10:56 AM - JRGopalReva: I hope the water level reduces by couple of hours.
8/29/22, 10:56 AM - +91 99459 37777: buses/tractors/trucks are plying on the road
8/29/22, 11:01 AM - +91 98802 82111: My only worry is what will we do in case there is an emergency and both our gates are unoperational!!!
8/29/22, 11:04 AM - JRGopalReva: the back gate approach to go back to sarjapur road is also not that great.
8/29/22, 11:15 AM - JRAbhishek: <Media omitted>
8/29/22, 11:18 AM - +91 72594 37677: This is worrisome .There has been incessant rains this monsoon and no solution to this water logging in sight .I feel really sorry for maids and deliver guys commuting through two wheelers 😭
8/29/22, 11:35 AM - JR103104Vivek: There are multiple issues due to which water logging is happening (Wipro, Slope on Ahad Road , drain.size , uphill water flow ,  Rajkulvee  connect is very narrow, virtual lake) . 

The best solution is to rework drain and raise the height of the road and for which  have been following with officials. Authorities are aware of this issue and  now to best of my knowledge, Fund approval for road work is in the final stage..

Will have more updates from the 3rd sept scheduled meeting.
8/29/22, 11:41 AM - +91 98802 82111: Thanks Vivek for the update...
8/29/22, 11:47 AM - +91 98801 52162: Im sure it is a complex issue to solve.. thanks Vivek and all other people chasing this issue
8/29/22, 11:49 AM - +91 90080 60684: If the road height near Wipro is increased then would the water logging start happening in front of JR?? Isn’t JR phase 1 entry at the lowest point between Sarjapura road and Back side road??
8/29/22, 12:37 PM - +91 98861 75303: Due to the rains and waterlogging most school dispersal time  have been preponed. Can we request to keep the gates open from 2:00 pm  to 4:30 pm
8/29/22, 12:55 PM - JRSatish34: It’s the same situation for Harvest too post the BWSSB pipeline work…the entire stretch of road is non existent with large craters
8/29/22, 3:01 PM - +91 98801 52162: Our approach road is all clean and dry now . As if nothing happened 😅

8/30/22, 6:11 AM - JR105Tarika: Just called the main gate

Informed the main gate
8/30/22, 6:46 AM - +91 99624 88008: Power supply is there for us single phase ..

8/30/22, 6:48 AM - +91 98458 22485: Same for us too
8/30/22, 6:49 AM - +91 99808 47825: Do not think, this is fixed yet. The electricity, backup gen all are shaky for last few days. Can we know latest update ?
8/30/22, 6:55 AM - +91 99808 47825: Logged a complaint with BESCOM for single phase issue in the community.

8/30/22, 10:34 AM - JRVenu: Even Sunny Brooks is in a similar shape.... that is adding to the traffic jam.
8/30/22, 11:10 AM - JR103104Vivek: I think only a section of Road "Sarjapur Road to Ahad Opus" where water logging happens will be raised, but we can put this forward and  get more clarity from authorities.
8/30/22, 11:13 AM - +91 72594 37677: Not only rainbow drive ...today even Sunny Brooks and also  near Wipro bus stop in front of Keerthi regalia
8/30/22, 11:16 AM - JRSatish34: Given the apathy of the infrastructure, I think the common man also  need to invest in inflatable amphibious vehicles along with their properties 😟😌 and not just 🚘 , 🏠 ..
8/30/22, 11:16 AM - +91 98802 06248: That would be ideal, but we need to have sufficient drainage under the raised road to ensure water spilling out from the Wipro campus gets a channel to the supoosed lake.

Also, can we request Wipro to ensure that water from their campus should be channelized to the drain at the front?
8/30/22, 11:17 AM - +91 96202 12548: Right now we have a nice slope from JR to Sarjapur road. If that is changed in any way then we will be at risk of water logging. At least one good thing now is that in addition to the slope, the water drains as soon as the rain stops for half an hour.
8/30/22, 11:18 AM - JRSatish34: Agree, emphasis should be on widening the storm water drain connecting to the rajakaluve
8/30/22, 11:19 AM - JRSatish34: and probably getting back the now extinct adjoining that disappeared over the last few years
8/30/22, 11:19 AM - JRSatish34: *adjoining lake*
8/30/22, 11:24 AM - +91 99459 37777: Thats right. 

Actually, Wipro has done massive rainwater harvesting (confirmed through multiple sources); also the water coming out from Wipro contributes maybe a third to to the problem. 

We should talk to our neighbours and check if there is any possibility of additional RWH for them (and similarly for us).

9/7/22, 10:14 AM - +91 90080 60684: *Post from my friend of Tata Motors,worth reading*

Dear Friends,

I am working in Tata Motors for last 16 years handling Vehicle Crash Safety and now handling Airbags, Seat belts and Steering wheel.  I have witnessed many crash tests,  designed and evaluated structures whether it meets the safety requirements,  currently designing Airbags, Seat  belts and steering wheel to make occupants safer.

There is a need to know some fundamentals for wearing seatbelt and related to our sitting position in the car .. 

I request all of you to read , understand and implement / follow for your safety ...share as much as you can.

1. Seatbelt is the primary protection and airbag is the secondary protection .

2. This means that Airbag alone will not protect WITHOUT wearing seatbelt , in fact it may hurt or kill or hurt badly..

3. Except hands holding the steering , *body ( trunk) shall be minimum 300 mm away from steering wheel*. 

Closer than this distance even if seatbelt is used and airbag operates, driver will not be protected .. so stay away from steering minimum 300 mm..( VERY IMPORTANT).

4. Sit comfortably and ensure the buttock is not tilted towards the steering it will make drivers slide in case of accident . Original seats are provided to prevent the slide..

5. Never-Never fix crash bars or the side bars in your cars on your own...These may protect the vehicle but will kill the passengers inside due to improper impact load transfer, and also altering the crumbling zone, based on which the Airbags are designed to respond in 35 Milli seconds ..

6. Airbags, seat belts, steering wheel, Airbag ECU, wiring harness must be replaced once it gets used. This must be done at the authorised dealer end only..

7. Headrest for driver and the co-passenger is very very crucial. With safety belt and airbags in  functioning condition without having headrest in the right place ( see vehicle manual for correct position) will break the neck after the impact ..I saw the video and clearly seen how important it is to have headrest in position .. 

I am not sure how many of us are aware that headrests are detachable and they carry sharp wedges at the end, which can be used for breaking the window if one is stuck inside the car, post accident.

8. Irrespective of distance to travel wear seatbelt , it is not for long drives only, it is the impact that matters not the distance ...

9. All passengers ( front and rear)  to wear seatbelt ...kids need to be protected well too with safety cradles...

10. Be careful in keeping loose items in the car .. as they could turn into missiles on high velocity impact ...put them in the boot..

The amazing engineering that had gone into these delvelopments , for our safety, incorporated by carmakers have to be used for protecting us and our near and dear ones. 

SAFE DRIVING , SAFE LIVING.

9/12/22, 12:36 PM - +91 96631 79336: Same problem for dry waste collection. Raised compliant on Mygate but no action.
9/12/22, 1:01 PM - +91 96631 79337: Raised concern multiple times that empty coconuts also not getting picked up. Everytime either have to do it ourselves or stand outside in the morning so that it gets picked up. Not sure what's the reasoning behind this. And garbage collector leaves 50% of waste inside the bin only.
9/12/22, 1:05 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents 
Spoke to Hasirudala operations  Supervisor Mr.Ajay  and he will visit tomorrow.
I called him tomorrow to check the collection staff   to give proper training .
Thanks
9/12/22, 1:08 PM - JR105Tarika: +1 I have complained several times about this .he leaves half of the stuff and picks up half 🙄
9/12/22, 1:21 PM - +91 96631 79337: What's the solution here? Any suggestions pls
9/12/22, 1:29 PM - JR105Tarika: Dear I hope it will be solved after tomm 🙏
I usually call main gate n tell him to come back 🙏
9/12/22, 2:16 PM - +91 96321 27755: In our previous apartment the garbage collector wears a gloves and brings along a sponge with their bins on a trolley (easy for them to move it around too). They wipe the dustbin with the sponge once they put the garbage in the collecting bin. It was easy to clean the bin after that and all the waste is fully collected by them. 
I am not sure if the agency will so many things to these guys, I have seen them bringing a small bucket kinda bin and carrying it out.
9/12/22, 3:32 PM - +91 96631 79337: Here also they have gloves but not sure about sponge..we can give them this idea if that helps

9/24/22, 7:55 PM - +91 96638 49641: As many of the residents may be aware, there was a community event for the ladies planned in the party lawn today from 5 pm till 8 pm. Women from 70 families have participated in the event. 

An untoward incident has happened that someone has called the cops at 7:30 pm to stop the event. 

Cops are getting called in the community at the drop of a hat like Zomato and Swiggy. 

We request intervention from the association members on this matter. Also, to be inclusive of the whole society, we need clear guidelines from the association on the to-do's and to-do-not's for any kind of personal/ social events.
9/24/22, 8:02 PM - +91 96062 66933: Living in a community needs a sensible tolerance from everyone and this should not only be practiced by all but all enforced by MC. 
The guidelines of 10 pm is understandable and followed.
Calling the cops in a community event definitely depicts the hostility.
9/24/22, 8:04 PM - +91 97418 32223: This is tragic and shameful to have cops being called for such an event. We are living together, can't this be discussed among residents or brought up with MC if someone is facing issue.
9/24/22, 8:08 PM - +91 97418 32223: @918105152164 and other MC members - last year, when I was in MC, we drafted a rule book for raising complaints which empowered security followed by MC members to address grievances being raised by residents. Was the protocol followed in this case or were the cops called without informing security or MC?
9/24/22, 8:15 PM - +91 96202 12548: Yes, this doc was created last year when another law and order issue happened on 5th cross last year. This is unfortunate. People have to become more tolerant when living in a community. Every now and then you hear incidents of neighbours calling cops on others or just going to another person's villa and threatening dire consequences. Where are we living?!
9/24/22, 8:22 PM - +91 99015 00851: Did someone complaint from JR Greenwich or Ahad Euphoria?
9/24/22, 8:25 PM - +91 90080 60684: JR
9/24/22, 8:30 PM - +91 96202 12548: Please continue the party till 10:00
9/24/22, 8:30 PM - +91 99015 00851: Hi all, we are opening the women's Bollywood party for all to join for next 1 hr. Request to join if interested.
9/24/22, 8:31 PM - +91 96202 12548: Per community guidelines there is no issue. Please ignore and Enjoy!
9/24/22, 8:32 PM - JrAditya: Party has restarted... Please join back, everyone.
9/24/22, 8:36 PM - OwnerRajeshJRG: The person who was responsible for the act incurred is pointing out the incident happened on 5th cross. Someone is just not blind enough to go and threat without reasons. People are smart enough in pointing out only one side of the act here.
9/24/22, 8:40 PM - +91 97418 32223: Great to see the party resuming. I will request the  person(s) who had issue, to plz come and discuss, infact join the celebration! Let's live in harmony!
9/24/22, 8:45 PM - +91 99015 00851: Yes, I agree.
9/24/22, 8:50 PM - JRSrini: Living in harmony & community should be practiced by taking everyone along. Sad to know what happened. 

Having said that, request MC to hear out those who live near the clubhouse,  understand their views, concerns, and suggestions - do what's best for the community to live in harmony.

9/25/22, 11:07 AM - +91 97418 32223: I stand corrected. I was told that there were 2 train scenes in DDLJ, in the one from Europe, Simran had suitcase 😀
9/25/22, 11:08 AM - +91 99809 91057: Aunty mat kaho na 😊 Their spirit doesn't qualify them for this...
9/25/22, 11:08 AM - +91 96324 79094: Please use sunday to revise ddlj😊🙏
9/25/22, 11:09 AM - +91 96118 08899: Yeah ..my bad ..the youngest and the most spirited people ❤️
9/25/22, 11:11 AM - DrArunJR: Agree and this was the first train scene and not
Ja Simran ja
9/25/22, 11:19 AM - DrArunJR: Pics look fab.
Thank you all for putting so much effort and having fun together.
9/25/22, 11:24 AM - JRRohit100: Why don't you say clearly that ..galz please don't forget to call us next time 😉
9/25/22, 11:26 AM - DrArunJR: Even if they don't call- we will welcome ourselves 😏
9/25/22, 11:27 AM - JRSudhakar: Still, the gentleman from Villa100 was sighted in the otherwise exclusive ladies' night 😁
9/25/22, 11:28 AM - +91 97418 32223: I was abt to say that, i was told by multiple folks that one gentleman was there for the entire duration, Mr Rohit aka real Raj 🙂
9/25/22, 11:28 AM - JRRohit100: 🙂🙂 see you need to be at right place at right time .. i was ramu kaka ..took the job immediately before anyone could resist.. 😎

9/25/22, 11:33 AM - +91 99459 37777: प्रेम from HAHK .. :)
9/25/22, 11:34 AM - JRRohit100: Ok tips for you guys ..there are opportunities for everyone..tea , water , snack counters, photography, cake table arrangements etc etc .. and if this is not enough you can also have oppertunity to handle the Police 🚓

9/25/22, 11:36 AM - JRRahulTaneja: Ramu kaka ... 🤣🤣
9/25/22, 11:36 AM - JRSudhakar: Still prefer Ramu kaka's role...too many pearls of wisdom. Free to take any weekend sessions for the lowly illiterates like us?
9/25/22, 11:38 AM - +1 (858) 226-4612: Hi, My villa (58) is available for rental starting first week of October. Mine is a 3BR with 2000 sft. Please DM me if any one is looking for rental, I can provide the details
9/25/22, 11:45 AM - +91 95351 88288: Hello All..
We had a very eventful evening yesterday. Thanks to all the beautiful ladies and the most enthusiastic Senior Citizens...

On behalf of all the ladies and senior citizens , we want to know from the *person * the reason for calling the police 🚨 and spoiling the whole JRG environment yesterday. 

It takes a lot of planning and effort to organise such events, its not as easy as calling up police control room for no reason at all!!
9/25/22, 11:49 AM - +91 97170 49132: Totally agree...
9/25/22, 11:50 AM - +91 99015 00851: We should know the Gentleman's name!
9/25/22, 11:52 AM - JRHimanshu: Yes, It is very much needed to know the person and the reason behind because as per understanding of all this event was well organized under the guidelines of bylaws then what was the need of Police intervention.
9/25/22, 11:54 AM - +91 96118 08899: Yeah definitely and in a community calling police for such things only disrupts the harmony and is definitely not justifiable .. whoever has complained please let us know what could have not got sorted with any discussion on the table
9/25/22, 11:54 AM - JR105Tarika: <Media omitted>
9/25/22, 11:54 AM - JR105Tarika: He was religiously doing his job 😜
9/25/22, 11:57 AM - DrArunJR: Who - Rohit or the person who has called the police 🤔
9/25/22, 11:57 AM - +91 98802 82111: Hahaha
9/25/22, 12:00 PM - JRSudhakar: Very religious and lost in his work...highly dedicated
9/25/22, 12:01 PM - +91 97405 83964: And if that person is so much right in his own view to call the police, why not say it loudly? Why hide?
9/25/22, 12:04 PM - +91 97405 83964: <Media omitted>
9/25/22, 12:04 PM - +91 97405 83964: <Media omitted>
9/25/22, 12:05 PM - +91 97405 83964: <Media omitted>
9/25/22, 12:05 PM - +91 98802 82111: Totally agree... The evening that started with a bang ended leaving a very bad taste for all of us. It also leaves us wondering if celebrating within the community with the neighbours can disturb the peace and harmony!!!! I am sure if that someone had instead approached us we could have understood the problem/concern of that person....

Also if the concerned person did not want to speak with us directly, why did he not approach the MC!!!!!
9/25/22, 12:08 PM - DrArunJR: I guess we had complete movie- beautiful ladies, dance, (hero was missing though), police and common sense at the end...
9/25/22, 12:21 PM - JrAditya: If MC is also unaware of the person who called the police, then it's even more concerning.

We all know if the police has to take an action, then their first question would be, "Who is the President and the Secretary here?"

Hence I think it's not an option for the MC to be unaware of the person behind the complaint to the police.

Needless to say, the call to the police beats all the stated steps of escalations.
9/25/22, 12:22 PM - JR103104Vivek: This message was deleted
9/25/22, 12:23 PM - JR103104Vivek: There is a protocol which is setup by MC in case of any disturbance. Not sure why it is not being followed and for anything or everything either we get a धमकी of police or police in the society. What type of environment we are creating for ourself in the society and what about young kids whose faces were in scare yesterday after seeing everything
9/25/22, 12:23 PM - JR103104Vivek: We definately need to know who was the person who has complaint to police
9/25/22, 12:28 PM - Jr10RohithSujan: With so many messages floating in the group, I’m sure the person who called the police is reading them all. Either he/she doesn’t have the guts to claim responsibility OR has accepted the mistake and doesn’t want to be further humiliated
9/25/22, 12:29 PM - DrArunJR: Or the worse is that he doesn't care
9/25/22, 12:32 PM - +91 96638 49641: Even far worse, the 'suspected person' isn't even a part of this residents group. Those who know, they know!
9/25/22, 12:33 PM - DrArunJR: Oh, we are wasting our emotions 😂
9/25/22, 12:36 PM - JR103104Vivek: This is serious issue, if person had reason to call police then he/she should share and call out and how come without MC core commitee knowing about it, police is entering in society🤔
9/25/22, 12:41 PM - +91 96631 79336: He and one more person (don't want to put name 🙂) were Salman Khan, not ramu kaka..
Not sure if they were carrying Caterpalt (Gulel) 🙂🙂
9/25/22, 12:41 PM - DrArunJR: I am sure that MC knows. Would be better if someone from MC update all of us here. And what future steps have been taken or planned?
9/25/22, 1:01 PM - +91 96202 12548: All the guidelines were put in place already last year by the MC. At the end of the day, people who care and feel part of the community will follow them. The rest will just do as they please. So it's just a waste of emotions unless as a community we duly hold people accountable for not following these guidelines.
9/26/22, 9:11 AM - NipunJR: Hi All.. please DM me if there are any villas available for sale.
9/26/22, 9:31 AM - +91 95351 88288: Do we know yet a reason for the police to be called on us ladies? 

Are we living in a society where anyone can call police and anyone and not even have the courage to come forward and talk.
This is what we are reaching our kids. You have a problem , you don't talk about it, just call up police ( simplest option ).
9/26/22, 9:35 AM - +91 99728 07440: Dear Office bearers, Can we please have residents meeting on this issue as early as possible?
9/26/22, 9:36 AM - +91 99728 07440: I think all residents here would agree to have residents meet urgently
9/26/22, 9:36 AM - +91 96638 49641: Yes! An emergency 'All Residents' meeting is needed to address concerns from all affected parties.
9/26/22, 9:39 AM - +91 99015 00851: Yes, I agree. We should know the reason for calling police when planned ladies event was ongoing. Also, we must know the name of the individual who called the police and why? Should we stop upcoming events as calling police is becoming a fun act now.
9/26/22, 9:40 AM - +91 96118 08899: Can't agree more ...it is looking like some kind of dictatorship then ...people calling police as per their convenience .... For any society and it's individuals it is not a healthy atmosphere to stay it
9/26/22, 9:40 AM - +91 98802 82111: The moment a Resident calls the police directly without informing or involving the MC, it reflects the level of faith he has in the system.. it defeats the existence of the MC totally
9/26/22, 9:41 AM - JR103104Vivek: Yes we need all residents meeting to discuss this issue. We cannot have this type of environment for us and our kids.
9/26/22, 9:41 AM - +91 96118 08899: Living under constant threat and fear are not the things we signed up for
9/26/22, 9:42 AM - +91 96118 08899: I hope and believe the Association can excercise their power to take charge and get the name of the individual who did this
9/26/22, 9:43 AM - JRHimanshu: If we get to know who has done it then only, as requested by others, we can understand his/her concerns. 

Else it is just an activity to disturb the harmony of the society. It is totally unacceptable.
9/26/22, 9:48 AM - +91 99809 91057: If we do not settle it here its bound to happen again...so let's meet and address the concerns..
9/26/22, 9:52 AM - +91 98802 82111: Yes it can't be treated as the problem of one individual anymore... Saturday's shameful and embarrassing situation has already proven that it's now a problem of all the Residents... If not address and resolved at the earliest, let us be prepared for getting in such situation again and again...
9/26/22, 9:54 AM - +91 96638 49641: Primary agenda that we expect to be discussed and addressed:

1. Kids threatened and abused
2. Security guard & supervisor abused
3. Police(escorted by a lady police) called at a community event at 7:30 pm on Saturday
4. MC members abused publicly
5. Directives on social/private/religious events going forward
9/26/22, 9:54 AM - +91 90196 85428: The kids are abused. They are scared.  Security and MC is abused. What next ???
9/26/22, 9:57 AM - +91 78996 46443: We need to discuss this with the concerned person and sort it out amicably. Else, we will be living independently and not as a  harmonious society. I don’t see this as a future for our kids.
9/26/22, 9:57 AM - +91 99809 91057: Can we have declaration from each villa that they have not called Police...it will  conclusively single out the caller..since he is not on what's app group security can visit each villa
9/26/22, 10:00 AM - +91 99728 07440: Calling Police is  one of the five issues listed earlier in the message.. all issues needs to be addressed in residents meeting.
9/26/22, 10:00 AM - +91 96324 79094: by law, doesn't MC has right to know, who called the police without taking MC into confidence..
9/26/22, 10:01 AM - +91 77953 59366: I feel we can first address our concerns within the society instead of police intervention..also it was a planned community event
9/26/22, 10:04 AM - +91 97170 49132: If kids does not feel safe in their own society then it's an irony.. we should create a beautiful environment for them. Everyone should feel safe and have freedom to live. Organising events is secondary but living each day with freedom and safety is priority. I am sure with right communication it will be solved
9/26/22, 10:05 AM - +91 96324 79094: what will be next, calling police when our young kids are playing basketball at pm?
9/26/22, 10:07 AM - +91 99015 00851: Yes, If my kid does not play basketball then I may have to call the police. It's just a matter of dialling 100. 😀
9/26/22, 10:10 AM - JrVenkatChandana: This message was deleted
9/26/22, 10:12 AM - +91 91083 13377: I do agree that it's important to resolve the issue with the person who felt the need to call the police. Esp, if not everyone is present in this group, then we'll be discussing in a vacuum here (or even if we hold a meeting).
9/26/22, 10:12 AM - +91 96062 66933: There has to be a discussion on this shameful act. We are all a part of society and any threatening act needs to be sorted for everyone safety.
9/26/22, 10:12 AM - JRVenu: Hi Everyone,

We, the MC, met yesterday and have started working on possible next steps.  On the side-lines some of the folks have started the discussion with key members to ensure that we address the incidents that have happened in the last few days.

Please do understand some of the activities take a bit of time, please give us some time.  But please be assured that we are working to address the issues amicably and as fast as possible.

If anyone as any input and please do share the input with the MC members and request you to refrain speculations and give us the opportunity to address the issues.

Regards,
9/26/22, 10:12 AM - +91 96631 79337: If MC or we don't know who is the person called police then can MC pls suggest how can we find solution to this? We are living in a society where such get togethers, events are integral part. Can someone from MC team update here ?
9/26/22, 10:14 AM - +91 96118 08899: So are we aware who has taken this step then as further steps would have got decided based on the person calling the police ?
9/26/22, 10:14 AM - JRVenu: No... but we are findings ways to avoid them irrespective of who has called the police
9/26/22, 10:15 AM - +91 96118 08899: thanks .. hope to see some strong action and message considering the welfare of people staying
9/26/22, 10:17 AM - +91 96631 79337: Hope this solution consider other problems also like threating to kids, telling, screaming etc not just permissions for events and gatherings
9/26/22, 10:17 AM - +91 99001 66459: Hi,
Regarding police calling on Saturday, few are quoting my name for fun, I tell them in exercise have caution or u  will face dare consequences . One must  stop playing around with me.. Do note that  I am no way related to this issue. Do not follow blindly one or  two uncultured, uncivilised uneducated, untrained useless  idiots without using  your own god given senses and judgement.
If you are  still informed, confident and prove me wrong.  I will handover my property docs with registration on same day to you. . Otherwise u do so.  NOTHING LESS THAN THIS..  otherwise mind your own business , No baseless allegations/assumptions/speculations  and useless talk  any more for you and your family time pass.
If any one does not have job and idle, lots of social activities on demand  , I can help if u need. Otherwise please be  quiet and do not provoke others by sending garbage to groups and enjoy others fighting which is not good for you.. have  little maturity because  u are bloody aged, educated and experienced . 
2 or 3 idiots are  is seriously playing with my peace and trying to  spoil my name, not in a mood of listening from anyone including. I will  handle those creatures  separately in my own ways.

9/26/22, 10:18 AM - +91 96633 05410: Very important to have this discussion with the concerned. The society cannot bow down to anyone's whims and fancy.
9/26/22, 10:19 AM - JRHimanshu: Thanks Venu for your response.

I hope "bit of time" remains bit of time and we see some strong action, message and guideline from MC *soon.*
9/26/22, 10:31 AM - +91 96861 11715: People are openly threatening in group. It is not good for society. To avoid speculations and embracement for others MC should disclose the name of the person who has given police compliant.

9/26/22, 10:57 AM - +91 97418 32223: Threatening tone and use of abusive words is a big NO in this group. Admins - please take note of it. @918105152164 - with the kind of language being used, even more important to have a residents meeting now than ever.
9/26/22, 11:19 AM - +91 99861 63980: I totally agree, communication is the only way to solve these issues.
9/26/22, 11:32 AM - Bhagavan: Humble, Humble request to all.

9/26/22, 1:51 PM - JRVenu: If any input please share with your friendly MC member.
9/28/22, 12:41 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents and MC members,

I understand that the last few days have been trying days for the community.  I have tried to be a calming force and have been asking the MC team to be a calming force.  But unfortunately, I am not being successful in this. We have been having meeting with the parties and trying to do the needful, but that requires trust in the parties and the willingness to want to get to a solution.

I understand people are upset, but I am sad to see that the community is going through a mob mindset with all the messages, and comments (from MC and from community) have been very negative and insinuating.  We are moving very very far from “Harmonious community” and becoming a highly polarized community. The adrenaline is pumping hard and calmness is not coming back.  I cannot with an honest conscious preside over a MC that is not calm and just keep promoting calmness, nor be part of a MC that is not a calming force to the community.

My request all the senior citizens to help play a part in calming the community and promote discussion.  Everyone of us will benefit from you experience and guidance.

So, with immediate effect, *I am resigning from my post as President of JRGSHOA and also the MC*.  I would like to request the MC team to elect and interim President to take things forward.

@Ananth… as the Secretary I guess you need to send me the acceptance of the resignation so that it is documented, and we move forward.
@Nidhi you have done an amazing job as a Treasurer and hope to see you continue the good work. Please request the banks to deactivate my access so that it can be transferred to the next President.

Thank you all for the opportunity to serve you, and hope I was able to deliver some value to the MC and the community.

Regards,
Venu Reddy (Villa 129)
9/28/22, 5:19 PM - +91 98802 06248: Dear Residents, 

This is to inform you that one our residents is hosting a private party at the Club House lawn this evening.
Per the prevailing law, they have sought the required permissions from the civic authorities to play music on a loud-speaker between 7-10PM.
They have taken all precautions to ensure no one is inconvenienced due the same.

However, in case any of you have concerns, please reach out to the said family and/or anyone in the MC, such that the same can be communicated and taken care of.
Let us all play our part as good citizens and wish the family on the joyous occasion.

Kind Regards,
MC JRGSHOA
10/1/22, 11:23 AM - ~ Ananth added JRNiranjan
10/1/22, 3:38 PM - JRNiranjan: Dear All,

This has reference to the recent incident in our JR Greenwich community that led to levels of misunderstandings and escalations that are rare in a society like ours. 

Few of us had an opportunity to dig deep into what went wrong. The discussions helped identify the  mis-conceived expectations and notions within our community members. 

Instead of listing them as pin pointers, we are making an attempt to provide notes of clarification in 3 broad categories as below :

*1)Nature of our community - the constituents and their surroundings within the layout*:

JR Greenwich is a BDA approved layout consisting of independent plots and Villas registered to the concerned buyers. The common areas like roads and parks are registered to BDA. Club house is built on JR Housing plots, being maintained by the Association. 

In nutshell, it’s like a micro-community that is there in BDA layouts of Indiranagar or Koramangala, except that we enjoy a project boundary wall to provide additional security to its residents and dedicated amenities as mentioned above.

 *2) Specific roles and responsibilities of RW Association and the MCs*:

We would like to reiterate that Association’s primary role is to maintain the common areas of the community by collecting proportionate maintenance charges from the residents/plot owners. Needless to say supply of water to homes, back up power,  water, lighting in common areas, repairs and fixes to common layout infrastructure, general housekeeping,  security, deciding norms for ongoing constructions etc are some of  the major deliverables for the association.

From an advocacy perspective, our Association is also expected to coordinate with local government bodies and private agencies  for utilities/ services  beneficial to the community eg. broadband, water supply, gas pipeline, road etc,.

Association is *not* responsible to handle litigations or court cases on independent plots or members thereof. It has to be handled by the respective impacted parties only.

Association is *not* responsible to file, handle / settle any legal disputes between the members, that have arisen due to an act of one or more of such members in their individual capacity.  However, if requested and the MC finding such requests relevant, the association may choose to facilitate for a peaceful dialogue between the parties in the larger interest of the community.

*3) Roles and responsibilities of individual members/residents*:

Role of individual member/ resident is the same as the role of any Citizen of our country. 

Residents do not have any higher privileges being a resident at JR Greenwich apart from amenities being made accessible at one place and becoming part of a vibrant gated community.

If an individual has any concern with a neighbor, the aggrieved member has every right to be heard in accordance with the applicable law as provided. 

It is our responsibility to understand the provisions of all applicable laws keeping in mind the judicial saying "ignorance of law is no excuse".

At the same time, we humbly urge residents not to take law into their hands and resort to any acts of violence disturbing the very nature of our peaceful community.

On behalf of all the parties that are responsible to build this layout to the level that it is today, I urge all the members to take note of the above points and help grow this community to a vibrant one and making it harmonious & peaceful in its true sense. 

We very much appreciate your support in this regard. 🙏🏼

Warm regards,
Niranjan Reddy,
Developer of JR Greenwich &
Office bearer of its Welfare Association

10/7/22, 8:29 AM - +91 86609 99622: Good Morning, not sure if this is the right forum to raise this, please do share with relevant people/authorities who can address this.

Since phase 3 Road has opened and vehicles started using, I’m noticing there is no speed control and people drive their cars & bikes on high speed including school buses sometimes.

Case in point just 2 days back a car came very fast and ran over the stray dogs without even noticing it’s on the road. Good thing is nothing happened to the dog as it went under the vehicle and came out with minor hit, the car driver didn’t even stop and had no remorse for doing it. 

My concern is that Today it’s dog tomorrow it could be humans.

Is there anyway to request concerned authorities to put couple of speed breakers on this stretch to minimise/avoid vehicles speeding and causing potential accidents .
10/7/22, 9:03 AM - JRNiranjan: We will plan to add couple speed breakers on this stretch to avoid such accidents. Thank you for reporting the issue 🙏🏼

10/7/22, 12:28 PM - JRNidhi: Dear Residents,

We have moved the JRGSHOA account to ICICI Bank from Federal Bank. This gives us additional benefits of easier vendor payments and maintenance collections. All transactions ( including maintenance, CH booking, move-in/out, etc) would be done online to our account. We would be sharing the Virtual account bank details with the next demand note.  Alternatively, you can take advantage of ICICI online payment gateway for all payments through UPI, netbanking and all major credit/debit cards.

Also, a reminder that the quarterly demand note would be raised next week. We would also be raising an additional demand note for capital expenses incurred this year.


Thank you for your cooperation,

10/19/22, 3:41 PM - +91 96062 66933: The maintenance of the green area is deteriorating by the passing day. The green park has more weeds than grass. 
The side walking tracks is all weeds. There is tall weeds around the grass in the muddy  plantation sides. 

This will slowly takeover the look of area. Can built up rodents and reptiles and very risky for kids playing around.

Also curious to understand why there are 2 demand notes here?
10/28/22, 4:11 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents/Members,

We have been getting quite a few queries on demand note that was sent to help build the CapEx funds for JRGSHOA.  This is the fund that should have been technically in excess of 50L (50K x 100 villas). But we currently have only 33L in this account.

The deficit in the corpus is primarily due to a number of capital expenses that we have invested in the last 4+ years.  As you can understand, we need to build this fund back as we are getting to the point where there will be many infrastructure related upgrades and investments that we need to do.  We understand that we cannot get to the 50L level in one step, and hence have asked for a 1st level of replenishment by asking for 10K from each of the villa.

The infrastructure investments that we are doing will benefit all the current villas, and upcoming villas.  For instance, the upgrades and cleaning of drains, the compliance and upgrade of STP, and the addition of street light poles and replace them.  These items will be done for all plots occupied or otherwise.

We have discussed this in the MC meetings, and later even discussed this in the open house that was conducted a few months back.  In addition to the meetings, we have also mentioned the need for this additional demand notes in our past communications.

I hope this message will address most (if not all) of the queries, and we hope to have your support in building back the corpus fund.

PS: The regular maintenance demand note will be coming out next week.  That has nothing to do with demand note we sent out earlier for 10K.

Thank you all.

11/20/22, 9:51 AM - +91 98864 35931: Does anyone uses a internet mesh router here? Does it work with concrete wall, multiple floor? If not mesh, how do u manage good internet signal in all floors?
11/20/22, 9:54 AM - +91 99808 47825: For us, we have two providers ACT and Airtel. Have got 4 routers across floors and corners with a master / slave configuration. It gives full strong coverage across.
11/20/22, 10:24 AM - +91 99011 99902: Hey Sambit

We have a TP link main router on ground floor which gives good coverage for the 1600sqft plot

For first floor, we have a TP link wifi extender which gives good coverage but a speed drop of around 50%, which is fine because of our 250mbps connection 

Mesh takes care of network switch

11/24/22, 10:31 AM - +91 96321 27755: Chakras are widely discussed in alternative therapy and even in biofield sciences today.

12/19/22, 10:16 AM - +91 99459 37777: Just heard from few kids regarding the heated pool.. 

does anybody have more info on what/why/how??
12/19/22, 10:43 AM - JR103104Vivek: Was this in the agenda of meeting pre-hand? There cannot be a sudden decision and that to closing it down in winter breaks for kids. What were options considered to reduce bill?
12/19/22, 10:47 AM - JRRohit100: Why ? When ? How ?
12/19/22, 10:51 AM - JRRohit100: To open the heated pool there was a survey open to all, multiple options were thought and given to residents, we all voted,agreed and commited. How come the decision of shutting it down made without all of this ?
12/19/22, 10:54 AM - +91 99459 37777: As an MC member, we haven’t remotely heard about the need to have this topic discussed in the AGM or MC meeting (forget about so much talk of MC acting in unison, parallel MC, etc, when the MC members themselves are not even aware of this!!). 

Fact being that the heating equipment was procured by the builder for society’s betterment and after *months of relentless deliberation*,  surveys sent to the residents, the decision of enabling the heater was taken. 

*If there is a problem, it should be discussed within the MC group first, followed by call of constructive solutions, instead of whimsical and hasty decision.*

Yesterday’s 1) Meeting agenda not published upfront, 2) agenda not even discussed with the existing MC, 3) MoM not published and the decision already communicated to the kids :) !!  

 It underlines *autocratic* ways of operation, when the whole point brought forth by the outgoing President in the last AGM was of having “one connected MC”.
12/19/22, 10:55 AM - +91 99805 44153: IMHO...Lets wait for an official  communication from MC.
12/19/22, 10:58 AM - Bhagavan: Agree, 

Request everyone to hold till MoM is published.
12/19/22, 10:58 AM - JRVenu: Folks,

As part of the AGM various topics were discussed (one of them being the heated pool).  Multiple items were voted by members who attended the AGM and decision will be taken based on the votes at the AGM.

We will be sending the minutes from the AGM.

Regards,
On behalf of the MC @ JRGSHOA
12/19/22, 11:07 AM - +91 96118 08899: Probably a small feedback..if a voting is supposed to happen on such a matter which obviously concerns many .. please let the members  know in advance so that people can ensure they are not missing anything . I believe most of us will agree with it . Also we should atleast have the people who were part of the initial decision available
12/19/22, 12:12 PM - DrArunJR: Venu,
Such decisions can't be taken when no pre announcement was given. A lot of residents are getting the benefit of heated pool.
If cost is a concern - then we should look for options to reduce the cost.
Still concerned - stop all the amenities and have a poll for everything.
In a society we should live in harmony and decisions can't be made based on the opinion of very few members.
Hope to step into heated pool from tomorrow onwards 🙏
12/19/22, 12:28 PM - JRVenu: Please note that Venu did not take the decision. The AGM did it. The attending members decided. This is a AGM open to all members. Please stop making it a Venu decision.

12/23/22, 8:09 AM - +91 96062 66933: These incidences are increasing, owners should take responsibility as this can be serious.

12/23/22, 9:35 AM - +91 97312 07112: Basic question: Are pets necessity of modern day life?
Especially, in a protected environment like JRG...?
12/23/22, 9:52 AM - JRRohit100: IMHO Keeping pets is more than the necessity of feeling protected, raising them is about luv, affection and companionship. Moreover for different people there could be a different motivation for example workout in the morning or getting socialize. I am sure we can resolve this intermittent issue by taking necessary actions 👍
12/23/22, 9:53 AM - +91 96202 12548: Hello all, we are dealing with this in the pets group. Request all to refrain from posting further on this topic.

Request you to stop your pets from urinating on cars parked in our society. This is certainly not a pleasant sight to witness or come to know of later,  especially if one owns that car 😜

I believe there should be designated places within or outside our society for relieving your pets. If not, perhaps taking this up in JR pets group and MC team is a way to get this resolved.

But by all means, spare the cars please and do not be a reason to spoil private property. 

I hope good sense prevails. Thank you. 🙏

1/8/23, 2:54 PM - +91 96118 08899: A request ...could we please take up the heated pool discussion as the next agenda , swimming classes for kids are forced to stop completely due to cold water . The pool is totally unusable due to this , hope everyone understands the concern .
1/8/23, 3:19 PM - +91 96062 66933: We need to take this discussion. 
Previous decision was definitely forced and not at all per a proper bylaws of proposed agenda !! 
Individual emails are sent but yet to receive response.
1/8/23, 4:14 PM - +91 99459 37777: Emails don’t get responded to, and WhatsApp group turn to admin-only at drop of hat!! 

Who decides the groups will be read only, and why?? This is absolutely aghast and unacceptable. 

The topics of society level importance should be discussed with enough advance notice.
1/8/23, 4:20 PM - JR103104Vivek: Totally agree, suddenly group is turned to read only which implies imposing without even allowing any discussion. Anything which impacts wider community members cannot be decided on basis of few attendee
1/8/23, 5:30 PM - JrSashidhar: +1
1/8/23, 5:42 PM - +91 90667 05125: Request MC to also publish the conditions under which whatsapp groups can be made admin only. 
The rationale was totally unclear at least to me for the last event, it would be helpful for residents to know what posts can trigger admin only action.
1/8/23, 7:18 PM - +91 98802 06248: Instead of whatsapp discussions can we have people come in and have a discussion "in person" on how we can rationally deal with the high costs of running a heated swimming pool.
1/8/23, 7:35 PM - +91 96118 08899: Thanks for the response ananth , exactly this is what we had been saying and  was expected in the very first place ..that's why u see the unrest . We hope The association also echos your thought ..and let's decide on the date and time , we shall be there . Hope to hear from MC soon
1/8/23, 7:36 PM - DrArunJR: I believe this is rationale, however unless it gets notified before the AGM- no one will have an idea that this is going to be discussed
1/8/23, 7:37 PM - DrArunJR: Echoing Ruchi, reason for dissatisfaction was lack of notification before the AGM
1/8/23, 7:39 PM - DrArunJR: And it has been more than 15 days and none of the emails were responded. 
Would also appreciate if MC lets us know regarding a rational time that we should expect an answer
1/8/23, 9:52 PM - JRVenu: Residents of JRG,

One of the messages in the group was asking what is the parameters when WhatApp group get locked.  I was drafting a set of parameters… but realized that the messages have evolved from whatsapp to voice calls. So realized that there is no point in sharing any guidelines.

During the last few days lot of hate filled and negative calls questioning the competency of the MC have been coming to some of the MC members.  The calls not got to a point that they started impacting personal and family lives of MC members. If the intension is to insult and harass the few volunteers that were willing to help run the association… CONRATULATIONS… you have just succeeded.  *MC members are already starting to regret their decision to volunteer and are thinking of resigning. *  

If MC members start resigning… we will have to dissolve the MC.  I guess we can have our own version of the wild-west.

Despite what each of you think… there is lot of work happening in the background on the heated pool and many of the points that were raised in the AGM.  All of these items need lot of time and effort from many folks as we need to find solutions that is acceptable by all parties.

The strange thing is that none of the individuals who are making all these allegations are either willing to contribute the time or help run this community operations.  These folks are just calling and messaging to spread negativity.

NONE of the MC needs the extra stress.  We keep spending many hours every week and all the MC members are getting is calls and messages from the community questioning their intentions and competency.  Hence the reluctance to be part of the MC… because, being a MC members does not looks like helping build and manage a vibrant community, it looks like an excellent recipe to convert friends/neighbour to enemies.

*Please do let us know if you do not want a Management Committee*… and you will find a way to magically run the community.  I am sure the MC will be happy to step down and let each of you run your own show.
1/8/23, 10:05 PM - +91 96118 08899: With all due respect to all the  MC members and with appreciation to their efforts in making the community a better place ... It is actually not just about making laws rather it is about  taking everyone together .i truly believe even MC knows people can't accept things if they don't agree to it ..The residents have all the rights to question the laws etc ..as long as we get justifiable answers or for that matter timely answers there won't be any conflicts . We all believe in a happy and warm community however not at the cost of not voicing opinions . Hope the best sense prevails and something gets concluded 🙏
1/8/23, 10:05 PM - JRNidhi: Thank you for this message. I am surprised and shocked that a heated swimming pool is the only important concern in this community. The other efforts done by the MC seems irrelevant and useless.
1/8/23, 10:07 PM - JRNidhi: Pls join the MC and help out. Your help would be valuable
1/8/23, 10:08 PM - +91 96118 08899: Hey nidhi ..if it is allowed to have two members i will be more than happy to join
1/8/23, 10:08 PM - +91 96118 08899: Two members from one family i meant
1/8/23, 10:09 PM - JRNidhi: Lets look at the by laws and look at the possibility
1/8/23, 10:09 PM - +91 96118 08899: Sure ..m up for it 👍
1/8/23, 10:11 PM - JRNidhi: But yes, to all those who questioned  the MC's decision on closing the group, we can do it again if the discussions get ugly.
1/8/23, 10:13 PM - +91 96062 66933: Heated pool definitely is a concern however not the only concern. Requesting reasoning for one topic didn’t absolutely mean that other topics are either sidelined or not paid attention too. 
It’s not about allegations or sidelining, it’s about doing the right thing in right way !! 
Threatening of dissolving MC could not always be the only way to move forward. 
All residents cannot be a part of MC, but yes, agree that with proposed agenda, should be part of meetings.
1/8/23, 10:17 PM - JRVenu: We had only 4 people that have even raised the hand for being part of MC.... I think we are far away from the whole community being part of MC.  Dissolving MC will happen when enough MC members resign... no one is threatening to dissolve the MC.
1/8/23, 10:20 PM - +91 95351 88288: <Media omitted>
1/8/23, 10:21 PM - JRVenu: it means that we will have to find a way to run the community without a MC
1/8/23, 10:27 PM - +91 97312 07112: MC job is thankless job...!
1/8/23, 10:35 PM - JrGopal128Wood: We are in a precarious situation where people do not have time to join a meeting that was notified in advance nor do they have time to go through the bye laws in detail nor the minutes of the meeting that has points specific to questions being raised. Consistent pointing fingers will take us nowhere. Suggest we stop writing back and forth in this forum. The MC had its first meeting and let us wait for further communication from them. Else, in the interest of arresting the bad feelings, the group may have to go only admin managed as happened earlier.
1/8/23, 10:38 PM - +91 98802 06248: This message was deleted
1/8/23, 10:43 PM - JRNiranjan: Dear All,

As the closure/suspension of the facility was not intimated in advance in previous AGM agenda, we will work with MC to send an online voting to the residents to decide upon such important decision.

Kindly refrain from posting regarding the heated pool topic until then. 

Please allow us few days to work this through with MC 🙏🏼.

Peace ✌️

Regards,
Niranjan - JR Housing.
1/8/23, 11:05 PM - JRSanthosh: Let us look at previous voting results that happened already before we take up new voting . I suggest to have discussion with all members before one more voting is initiated as previous MC did not completely respect that voting.

We also need to discuss what really is a heated pool (is it just the heating coil in the pool?)
I suggest MC take expert opinion on how a heated pool should be engineered..
Also let the MC share what was the projected increase in cost before current implementation vs what's the actual being paid now.

Thanks to All MC members for your patience 🙏
1/8/23, 11:11 PM - JRRohit100: Responding to specifically the query about heated pool engineering - there was meticulous background work done on the same and it can be shared with all the residents in our next meeting on the topic . We had considered and weighed all the possible options before finalizing on coil based heating .
1/8/23, 11:39 PM - JRSanthosh: Ok Let us have that discussion..👍

I am Lekhya , a 15 year old baker and animal lover. 
Its been over a year now since I opened "Wild Bakes" and now it's time to expand. 
I am launching a project called "Save Paws" in order to care for the street dogs. 
Over the past few months I have conducted a few baking classes for children for raising money to serve this cause . I have also saved the money I earned over the last 2 months in wild bakes for the same 
 However, the impact would be bigger with your support. 

Below I have attached my project proposal . I request you to go through it and if  you want to be part of this mission and make an impact kindly fill the google forms given below. 
I hope to raise some money and have a successful project.

On a lighter note, Karnataka elections are nearing, expect more action 😂
1/21/23, 7:18 PM - +91 72594 37677: Wil the back gate be open ?Do we have alternate routes ?
1/21/23, 7:33 PM - JRVenu: Hi folks... please give some time until tomorrow noon. The MC will discuss with Niranjan for phase 3 gates and the developer on east side on the back gate. Will update you soon.

1/22/23, 3:46 PM - JRVenu: Dear Residents and Neighbours,
After discussion with Niranjan Reddy, he has agreed to keep the 2 gates next to Phase 3 open for the 3 days (Monday to Wednesday).  We request all the residents to use road from besides phase 3 and via Hadosiddapura to get back to Sarjapur road.

Since the school buses will be coming very early in the day (8AM) and the road work might not be starting by 8AM, we will instruct the security to inform the school buses of the interim arrangement until the work is completed.

Request all residents with school going kids to also convey the message accordingly.

Regards,
On behalf of MC, JRGSHOA
1/22/23, 7:26 PM - +91 98801 52162: Hope the approach road will be open for pedestrian walking. Older children should be able to walk home if dropped at main road
1/23/23, 8:01 AM - +91 70266 17733: Can you please share the route map that I can share with the bus driver to access the other gate?
1/23/23, 8:13 AM - +1 (978) 944-8993: +1. The school bus driver just called to say he doesn’t know the route and that he may drop the kids off at the main road. 😕
1/23/23, 8:18 AM - +91 97405 83964: Gentle reminder for the entries submission. For the information of many new faces to the community, any dance/skit/song/music etc. performance are good to go. Flow of the event is:
*Thursday 9am 26Jan
1. Flag hoisting and parade
2. Cultural program
3. Snacks distribution*
1/23/23, 9:44 AM - +91 77950 19322: If anybody organizing cultural program for teens please let me
Know
1/23/23, 11:05 AM - OwnerRajeshJRG: Has the road been closed now, anyone aware?
1/23/23, 11:05 AM - +91 99624 88008: All fine .... It is not closed yet..

1/23/23, 12:11 PM - JRVenu: Folks... work seems to be starting on the road leading to Sarjapur road. Just an FYI
1/23/23, 12:26 PM - JRAbhishek: We just came back .Some scraping work has started but road is open. Guard was saying 3 pm as cutoff.
1/23/23, 1:08 PM - +91 70266 17733: School Bus driver had called to tell that the back gate was not open... Have called and let the maingate security to look into it
1/23/23, 1:17 PM - +91 70266 17733: The bus driver had taken the Ashram road and hence couldn't come back... Have asked him to take the other route
1/23/23, 1:18 PM - +91 98807 12711: School bus came around 1 pm via normal route
1/23/23, 1:20 PM - +91 70266 17733: Yes, now the bus came via the old route through approach road itself
1/23/23, 1:51 PM - JR18Jayakumar: I do not see an option to use back side / east gate; long ago, it used to be the maingate for a while, then has become an optional, now it seems it’s not an approachable road at all...  Is that adjacent to east gate a private property? is there a negotiation to use that gate for this kind of usage for long term?
1/23/23, 1:56 PM - JR18Jayakumar: Btw, ever since the Phase 3 gate has opened for public access, more rash driving between JR Greenwich main gate and Phase 3 connecting road... not just passenger car, but equally bad by all school buses. For the safety purpose need to have enough humps in at least 2 locations ~30 fts before both phase 1 & 2 gates.
1/23/23, 2:36 PM - JRBabuDanny: Is Airtel BB down?

*Starting a new batch Mar. 2023 immediately after the XI grade final exams, for CBSE XII Computer Science with Python.*

Following is a brief about my credentials:-

I am a Post Graduate in Computer Applications (MCA) with 16 plus years of corporate experience in the IT industry.

I have been taking classes for the last 5 years in Computer Applications (Java, Python, C++, etc.) and have coached around 60+ students of IX to XII grade of ICSE & CBSE boards. Have also prepared students for last 4 years for Computer Science A using JAVA examination as per the AP JAVA curriculum.

Please do get in touch with me if you are looking for some help and guidance for your children in Computer Applications. Also let me know if you need any references to get feedback on my classes. 

Thank you and Best Regards.

2/27/23, 1:50 PM - +91 78292 99422: Hi my daughter n her friends went for a swim yesterday around 4.30pm and since it is an indoor pool so even in the afternoon despite enough sunlight the water was very cold (17deg) . Is there any solution to this?
2/27/23, 1:54 PM - +91 77953 59366: My daughter came home shievering , despite the temperature outside,the  water is very cold..it's sad tht kids can't njoy swimming even during summer
2/27/23, 2:10 PM - DrArunJR: I believe this is high time that we change to previous status of having heated pool. 
If we can't use pool in summer months- then what is the use of having a pool. 
Mr Niranjan has also agreed that previous decision taken in AGM was not as per the by laws of JRG and we were asked to wait for sometime till association settles in. 
I guess two months is a long enough time to reach at a solution. 
If association needs to do more work on this- they may continue to do at their level and in the interim let the kids enjoy the heated pool.
2/27/23, 2:12 PM - DrArunJR: Also requesting association to not change the group settings to "admin only". 
If a question is being asked by multiple residents - then solution is not to make the group admin only
2/27/23, 3:34 PM - +91 98809 06432: I want to request association POC to share if any investigation was done about the shot-up of expenses of pool heating and if any reason was found.
In the meanwhile, please enable warming the pool again so that kids can enjoy.
2/27/23, 3:40 PM - JR103104Vivek: Why MC is working in non transparent mode for this issue. Last we heard was a commitee is formed, with no further info on what is update from that commitee, what is next plan of action, what is tentative time to conclude.
2/27/23, 3:55 PM - +91 99809 91057: The decision of closing heated pool was taken for 2 months .. so it should be started from March 1st. Please confirm

2/27/23, 10:38 PM - JRRohit100: *Update on Heated Pool*: 
Hi All, Let us address the ongoing concerns about the heated pool. There is a lot of background work being done on this. However, we haven't shared it with all so far because we wanted to come up with recommendations (with supporting data) before bringing it out to avoid any further confusion. 

*Actions so far by Heated Pool Subcommittee* 
• In *2nd week of Jan’23*, 3 members Sub-committee was formed  
• Team collected & documented all the relevant data, such as actions taken by the previous MC, Heated pool Vs. The solar decision, voting results, previous year's heat pump energy consumption/pattern, recommendations from the previous sub-committee, Avg monthly consumption in a year, etc. 
• We also discussed the various viewpoints that residents had, which they communicated through WhatsApp, emails, etc., and realized that any decision must be in alignment with the community as a whole 
• We extended the subcommittee to 7 Members(3MC + 4 Non-MC) at *Jan end*,  We have a balanced representation of varying opinions we received, The objective of this extended sub-committee was to find a collective, logical, and a long-term solution 
• Existing data was presented to all the Sub-committee members to brainstorm over the next few *weekly* meetings; once the team was on the same page with and agreed in principle that Solar is not an alternative to heat our indoor pool, we decided to move forward with what best we can do with the heated pump. 
• It was noticed that though we had sufficient data from our own pool, we did not have any testimonials to learn from, issues like 
         • Do we need AMC? If yes, how much is the cost? Any other hidden cost in the long run?
         • What is the ideal heat pool temperature?
         • any other society using this for more than five years? 
•  In *2nd week of Feb*, Team decided to survey 6-7 other societies that are using heated pumps, possibly in similar climatic conditions, and have been using them for more than two years 
•  In the *last two weeks*, we divided ourselves and interviewed the heated pool in charge of more than five such societies, collected the data, and debriefed the rest of the team 

*Where we stand today, Next action(s), and Timelines* 
1.	Once we complete the debrief on the remaining interviews will prepare the recommendations; this should be done hopefully by *this weekend*, again depending on the availability of the team members. 
2.	Next, we intend to call for a resident meeting((in person/online) to brief the findings and the next action. The meeting date shall be communicated as we progress on the first part.  

*Lastly*, we agree that communication with the residents was delayed. However, we assure you that the team has been working hard on this since its inception, and you will be satisfied with the research done to make the *right decision*. 

Regards
JRG Heated Pool Subcommittee
2/27/23, 10:43 PM - DrArunJR: Thank you Rohit for all the updates. We all appreciate the hardwork. 
However till the time we come at a consensus, let's restart the heated pool. 
This was communicated by the MC and we are just requesting the MC to honour their own words. Hope it's not too much to ask for.

3/4/23, 7:50 AM - +91 78292 99422: Hi , There is a honey comb in the tree outside our house and now the bees are building a new comb in our balcony n frequently come inside our rooms. We fear children or anyone of us could be stung. What should be the next steps taken by us here?
3/4/23, 7:52 AM - +91 99303 93232: Even gym glass has a big one. Messaged to Jayaram a couple of days back as well.

I see that we in JR are not painting any of the assets like fencing around the ground, iron mesh around tennis court, fencing around tennis court and these barricades that Abhishek mentioned… can we please take action before other assets get spoilt
3/4/23, 7:59 AM - DrArunJR: For adults, take 
Tab Atarax twice a day for three days. 
It will help to reduce itching and swelling 😊
3/4/23, 8:00 AM - DrArunJR: This is post exposure treatment. 
For prophylaxis; we need to remove honey comb
3/4/23, 8:01 AM - +91 97418 32223: Google helped to understand your last msg 🙂
3/4/23, 8:08 AM - +91 78292 99422: The combs are in common areas hence will the maintenance help in getting it removed or the process is to contact MC n any other steps involved?
3/4/23, 8:13 AM - +91 96638 49641: There's a big one on the water tank too next to tennis court.
3/4/23, 8:18 AM - +91 78292 99422: If they are big which means they are around from sometime. Is it on the list for maintenance to get them removed? Will writing a mail suffice to report my problem?

3/4/23, 9:07 AM - +91 97417 32877: We have one more infront of villa 203, have told Jayaram to remove it when it was too small but no action was taken.
3/4/23, 9:24 AM - +91 98801 52162: Bengaluru folks- if you have bee hive bothering your community, do not call pest control. They kill the bees. Instead 📞 Bee relocation service: +91 85538 14264 or Bee protection service (Apoorva): +91 94817 21022. Pls save these nos & pass it it on. (The nos are verified)
3/4/23, 9:27 AM - +91 98801 52162: While for us bees seem to be a nuisance, they perform a very important service to us - pollination. So try not to kill them, and see if something like the above service helps! It will protect both parties 😀
3/4/23, 9:48 AM - +91 96324 79094: Thank you Ashwini.🙏

No bees, no life.

3/14/23, 11:30 AM - JRNidhi: Dear Residents and Owners,

We are resuming the heated pool operations from today.
There would be no impact on the existing maintenance to the residents or the association as the incremental cost would be contributed by JR Housing.
We are going to implement multiple optimisations that are suggested by the subcommittee to save the energy consumption and the cost to maintain the pool operation. One of them is pool covers to reduce heat dissipation and is being  funded by JR Housing.
An email will be sent with details of the work done by the subcommittee.

Regards,
MC, JRGSHOA

3/14/23, 1:09 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Thx everyone involved to conclude this !!
3/14/23, 1:29 PM - JRNiranjan: Dear All,

Thanks to the MC for considering our request and taking a quick decision in this regard. Hope our community kids will be happy with the decision.

In brief, phase-3 and phase-4 villa owners who are also the members of the club will be subsidising the cost. Subsidy won’t end 🙂.

I would request anyone having questions about the subsidy to reach out to me directly. Let’s not use this forum for this discussion any further 🙏🏼.

3/19/23, 9:26 AM - +91 97405 83964: *Do you Know? - Being a REGISTERED Voter has a direct bearing on FUNDS and RESOURCES allocated to our neighbourhood*
If you are not a *REGISTERED VOTER IN MAHADEVAPURA* plz read further

Bengaluru has 27 Assembly constituencies and Mahadevapura constituency is a YOUNG constituency carved out in 2008

Mahadevapura Constituency area is 115.18 sq.kms while Chamarajpet Constituency is 4.31 sq.kms. Sample of other small area constituencies are also attached for reference

*Our MLA Shri Aravind Limbavali has to administer 27 times larger area and 3 times more registered voter population*

We all know there is still a large number of residents who have not bothered to REGISTER as Voters or TRANSFER their Votes from other parts of Bengaluru, Karnataka or other States

Many Civic groups and citizen volunteers have been trying hard to enrol more voters in the last few years and have seen good success 

*How does VOTER REGISTRATION impact FUNDING?*
Assembly Constituencies are carved out once in 25 years based on Number of Registered Voters and Census data 

1. The Government of Karnataka Grants have a bearing on the Constituency and funds get allocated per Constituency
2. BBMP Wards was carved out recently based on the Voter count
3. BBMP Funding and Staff allocation is dependent on Ward Count
4. Administration is spread thin if the area of the ward/constituency is larger
5. Government Services are also suboptimal if the area of administration increases

*What should we do?*
1. If you are NOT A REGISTERED VOTER in Mahadevapura, plz use online Voter Helpline website or app and REGISTER TODAY. Takes less than 12 minutes to complete
2. Encourage your friends and relatives to REGISTER as Voters
3. Encourage youngsters in the age group of 18-25 to APPLY and REGISTER as Voters

3/23/23, 9:32 PM - +91 98105 83337: Good evening, gentle request to all parents. There is an ongoing construction at plot no 16 on the second cross. Since it was a vacant plot earlier, lot of kids used this as a short cut.  A few kids still use that space however it is constrained now and there is a lot of construction material and nails all over the floor and it may hurt kids. Kids play hide and seek and all sorts of games and use it as a passage. I personally do not have any problems but there is a huge risk. Requesting all parents to advise kids not to use that space as there is a high possibility of getting injured. No other motive behind this message . Take care and have a lovely weekend...

Simple interactive communication is good to keep a healthy interaction among society. Some might not look at this in short term but it promotes peaceful environment.

I have an Airtel broadband connection with power backup for router+modem to ensure uninterrupted power supply

However, every-time there is central power drop, internet drops for a minute or so. Are others in the society facing the same issue?
Would appreciate if there is a known resolution
3/28/23, 12:15 PM - JRRahulTaneja: you can put router+modem on ups
3/28/23, 12:21 PM - +91 99011 99902: I have a UPS installed 
probably UPS not working effectively then

thanks for clarification 🙂
3/28/23, 12:39 PM - +91 98801 52162: Even if UPS is installed the momentary switchover still leads to wifi getting disconnected i think

4/1/23, 10:35 AM - JR103104Vivek: Physical Voter ID Card
It has come to notice that few residents haven’t received voter ID card though their application has been accepted and EPIC number generated. Please fill-up below google form in-case you haven’t received physical voter ID card. We will try to get physical card asap.

https://forms.gle/E5Lzai4L9bqB1sRG6

Please note EPIC No is sufficient to cast your vote in election even if you don’t have Physical Card. You can also download e-card from https://www.nvsp.in/ 
Thank You!
4/1/23, 10:39 AM - +91 96202 12548: Is a physical card necessary to vote?
4/1/23, 10:43 AM - JRThyagaraj111: Hi vivek
Request all such issues/initiatives  route tru mc. 

Let's avoid sending directly to the group. 

MC will discuss decide and take reqd action
4/1/23, 10:46 AM - DrArunJR: Why we need to route every message through MC?
Vivek put all the efforts to benefit lot of residents.
We can't wait for MC to send directives.
PS: i am still waiting for my email to be answered since December and January
4/1/23, 10:48 AM - JR103104Vivek: Why this need to go through MC? It has no association with society specific functioning.
4/1/23, 10:50 AM - +91 99015 00851: Thanks Vivek for sharing the message.
4/1/23, 10:56 AM - JRVenu: The VoterID is something that is nothing to do with the Association... we cannot take the responsibility for legal reasons.
4/1/23, 10:58 AM - +91 96631 79336: Thanks a lot Vivek for the valuable information.
4/1/23, 11:00 AM - +91 96638 49641: FYI. 

Vivek holds the position of Vice Presisent RWA Kodathi Panchayat. He may be taking up/communicating tasks directed by the Panchayat body itself. 

By making MC act as a firewall for all the activities, residents group is only going to be autocratic in nature.
4/1/23, 11:00 AM - JrAditya: This is really a great work you have put in over the years.
4/1/23, 11:00 AM - +91 90667 05125: Why MC? 
If a resident is doing good selfless work why MC route is needed, then do residents need to take permission from MC to any help to larger community?
4/1/23, 11:02 AM - JRRohit100: Request MC members not to abuse MC forum to  enforce their personal thoughts or suggestions, better discuss this in MC forum first .
4/1/23, 11:03 AM - +91 90667 05125: Thanks for clarification 👍

Latest update from Bescom JE  and he  is  suspecting that  there will be a cable  damage near Shanthigiri road .
And he is arranging  cable fault checking vehicle and it will come at 11 am to find out the exact location of the cable damage.
4/5/23, 8:39 AM - JRSrini: Thanks Jayaram. I spoke to JE as well. Explained him about the situation & inconvenience faced by residents. Asked him to expedite. He asked us to call him back at 9.30am.
4/5/23, 9:42 AM - JRVenu: Dear Residents,

There is a repair of the high tension line near Santhigiri Ashram and BESCOM is trying to get things fixed.  But it will take a bit of time for the repair to be completed.

In the mean time we are going to continue on the DG, but as you know the DG has been running for a while and is starting to heat-up. Over-heating of the DG will create issues and hence we will have to keep monitoring it.  If the heating-up of the DG continues, we might have to shut it down at 11AM for an HOUR (assuming that the repair will not be completed by 11AM).

I request all residents to make the necessary arrangements for the 1 hour shut down from 11AM to 12 Noon for any critical activities.

Sorry for the inconvenience… but the issues is outside our direct control and we are doing our best to push BESCOM.

Regards,
4/5/23, 9:48 AM - +91 81975 69436: Recently we did move out of JRG  exiting the group 

Thanks a lot 🙏
4/5/23, 11:10 AM - JRVenu: Quick update folks... the DG temp is holding well. Will continue to keep going... as it gets closer will give a short headsup before switching it off.
4/5/23, 11:49 AM - JRVenu: We started noticing the DG heat up... we will have to shut it down for 1 hour. We plan to shut down at 12:10ish and back by around 1:10ish

4/27/23, 11:00 AM - +91 98801 52162: Destiny finally pulled the trigger! 😔
 Reportedly Cape Town, the capital of South Africa, has been declared the world's first drought city!  Government there has indicated its inability to provide water from April 14, 2023 onwards. The tragic journey of the world has begun! Such a time may come upon us too! Use water sparingly. Stop wasting water. Remember that we also sent water to Latur by rail!
 Don't forget the fact that only 2.7% of the world's water is potable!
Invite group members in your area!
 Nearby dams have receded and the groundwater table has sunk. As a responsible citizen you can easily make this movement a success.
 1). Avoid daily car washes;
 2). Limit yard flooding;
 3). Stop running the water tap continuously;
 4). Save water along with many other measures;
 5). Repair leaking faucets at home;
 6). fix water leakage in the society;
 7). * Plant trees! protect the environment;*
 8). Use water sparingly to water plants…
Let us face this terrible crisis together!

 Send the above message to 5 groups... The virtue of saving water will surely happen! Because of us, the thirst of the thirsty will be quenched, the next generation will be protected from aquatic life.

 Plant trees! 🌳
 Save the environment! 🌴

5/14/23, 12:52 PM - +91 99459 37777: @919886680614  — several months back, we proposed few items for upkeeping thr pool — 

1) existing toilet to be converted into “WC + urinal” so that we avoid situations like exactly above. 

2) create an open air shower so that there is no barrier to take shower before entering pool (I observe many don’t today). 

3) create a drain/channel for spitting (probably towards the rear end of the pool which is still covered with greenery.
5/14/23, 12:53 PM - +91 99459 37777: Pls revisit above; all are essential to ensure Hygenic swimming area.

5/14/23, 1:15 PM - +91 97405 83964: Agreed Niranjan. However first i called estate manager and the response was that house keeping cleaned it in the morning and he was blaming me and wanted me to find out who did it. 

Reason for sharing it here is most likely this is done by a human/child (and not animal) as the rest room has a proper door. 

We need to put strict fines against such behaviour. 

As per Jairam and security, this is not the first time it has happened. 

On a lighter note, My nose saved me as I was not wearing my specs and couldn't first see it and about to turn on the shower. 😊

6/14/23, 11:30 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Got phy. copy y' day, but current reading # with back dated to Jun 5th or 6th...  not sure is that intentionally done to avoid the total unit in <200 pm
6/14/23, 11:31 AM - +91 90080 60684: Reading would have been taken 5-6 June may be
6/14/23, 11:34 AM - +91 90667 05125: I saw bescom folks taking reading on 12th but bill format may be standard,  mostly the next bill in July will have less reading.
6/14/23, 11:39 AM - +91 98802 06248: We got the Bill and have been asked to pay about 1K more thanks to the promised doles of the new Govt
6/14/23, 11:49 AM - JRSudhakar: Same here, not sure if this increase of around 1K is due to tariff increases effective from April onwards or this is the increased amount we have to pay each month thanks ot our generous govt.
6/14/23, 11:59 AM - Jr20Ananth: Got from other group- 
BESCOM REVISED TARIFF – EXPLAINED:
The slabs have been done away with and Rs. 7/- has been fixed per unit.

Fixed charges has been increased by ₹10/-

FAC charges has been hiked by 4.5 times.

Either all or some of these come into effect retrospectively, that's why the arrears.

Karnataka Electricity bill hike approximately :
(Includes Unit & FAC Charges & Demand of 1KW) 

100 Units then : Rs. 538/-
100 Units now : Rs. 952/-

150 Units then : Rs. 1023/-
150 Units now : Rs. 1520/- 

200 Units then : Rs. 1404/-
200 Units now : Rs. 2004/- 

FAC CHARGES : 
Then : Rs. 0.52 / Unit 
Now : Rs. 2.42 / Unit

i.e. For every 100 units, we are approximately paying Rs. 189/- more on the bill.

Total Unit / Rate:
Back then - 
First 50 : Rs. 4.10
Next 50 : Rs. 5.60
After that : Rs. 7.15

Now - 
Unit rate : Rs. 7/-
Fixed charges for 3KW at Rs.110/-  per KW 
Energy at Rs.7/-  per unit
Arrears for April and May (Fuel cost adj)

If Consumption of monthly units is below 100 - the rate per unit is Rs. 4.75 for complete 100 units + taxes + FAC charges + Fixed charges !

Do we have any directions from the association?

6/27/23, 8:15 AM - JrPrashanth47: *MUST READ - Important Traffic Advisory 2 : ORR Doddanekundi Flyover* 
🚩 _Plz circulate this message within your residential complex whatsapp groups & office groups_

*Context: Metro Works Gantry crane moving into critical position at Doddanekundi flyover*

Considering the benefit of a midweek holiday & lower traffic this week, the Metro work in the critical position is planned starting from the morning of *Tuesday 27th June 2023*

Based on a joint coordination meeting following are the plans for the works &  managing traffic below Doddanekundi flyover

🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧

*Count Down begins*
1. DBM Layer asphalting of the middle lane upto the Junction will be done on Monday 26th June night
2. ORR Service road from Vishnu Palace till Ferns City Road will be blocked for Traffic movement from morning of Tuesday 27th June
⛔️⛔️⛔️
3. Below the flyover, the Traffic towards Marathahalli will be diverted to the middle lane on Tuesday 27th June
4. Bagmane to ensure the Main Gate of Bagmane Constellation IT Park is closed and both IN/OUT Traffic is diverted through Goshala Road
5. On Thursday night 29th June the Gantry will move forward and be positioned infront of IDBI
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
6. On Thursday night after 10:00 PM and Friday Morning Ferns City Road residents would have to access ORR through the “Bus Stand plot” and reach Bhagini Hotel and return the same way
⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️⛔️
7. On Friday night 30th June the first set of U Girders will be installed in front of IDBI
8. On Saturday night 1st July the Second set of U Girders will be installed in front of Vishnu Grand

10. The Installation of the COMPOSITE GIRDER at the Goshala Road Junction is planned around 15th July

*What does it mean for Commuters in Four Wheelers  & Two Wheelers?*
1. All commuters IN & OUT of Bagmane Constellation, World Technology Center, GoldStone & Capital to compulsorily use the Flyover to reach or exit your campus. Do not come below the Doddanekundi Flyover
2. Residents of Durga Petals & Commuters going towards  Alpine Eco Road to compulsorily use the flyover. Do not come below the Doddanekundi Flyover
3. Residents in Doddanekundi village to use alternative route instead of using the Service Road
4. We anticipate FREQUENT TRAFFIC GRIDLOCKS below the Doddanekundi Flyover. So plz plan your trips accordingly
5. Hectic work would be happening in the night between 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. Plz avoid using both sides Service road if possible. Anticipate frequent & long traffic stoppages below the flyover

The *NEXT 6 days* are very critical in terms of Traffic Management. Request your cooperation with the Traffic Police & the Traffic Marshals who will be there to manage the Traffic Congestion

6/28/23, 8:34 AM - DrArunJR: Things are getting crazy inside the premises of JRG
People are driving at whatever speed they want to (mostly our own residents). No check on anything. We get a message from one of the residents and things improve for few days and after few days things get worse. 
We have asked association few times and no concrete steps have been taken so far. 
What we are waiting for- someone will get badly hurt and then we will wake up. 
Sad part is no update from association also. 
Requesting association to address this urgently
6/28/23, 8:35 AM - DrArunJR: As per my observation - four cars from phase II and two from phase I go at very fast speed. 
Don't want to reveal any names here. <This message was edited>
6/28/23, 8:40 AM - JRThyagaraj111: Hi 
If u find such things. Pl inform to security/EM.

Security will post in the group. U r name will not be disclosed. 
Just vehicle number is enough. 

Can't post security personal in every  road to monitor over speed.
6/28/23, 8:50 AM - JrSashidhar: We debated  about speed barriers , installing convex mirrors where there are blind spots . The last update was a  committee doing a study of what to install and the discussion fizzled. At least the speeding issue was on the table since 2 years now.  Appreciate if there are concrete steps implemented in that direction by the association.
6/28/23, 8:52 AM - JrSashidhar: Raj- u am not sure if complaining to security is the only solution. That is shortsightedness. What is the long term solution to prevent incidents ?
6/28/23, 9:12 AM - JRThyagaraj111: First take step 1..
6/28/23, 9:14 AM - DrArunJR: Is this your personal opinion or guidelines from the association?
6/28/23, 9:16 AM - JRThyagaraj111: This process we have already informed 4 to 5 months back. 
Not even one complaint registered about over speed. Neither from the security  nor from residents.
6/28/23, 9:17 AM - JRThyagaraj111: Without evidence mc Or anyone can't act. If problem blow the whistle.
6/28/23, 9:20 AM - OwnerRajeshJRG: Sir, please check with Jayaram most of the time we have raised the  over speed issue with him.
6/28/23, 9:37 AM - JRThyagaraj111: So far  neither security nor estate mgr received any complaint with vehicle number about over speed. 

If we receive definitely will post in the residents group as STEP-1.

Can't act without concrete evidence
6/28/23, 9:37 AM - JRThyagaraj111: <Media omitted>
6/28/23, 9:38 AM - JRThyagaraj111: Above message sent to group months back..  Form is still empty!!!!!
6/28/23, 9:38 AM - +91 86609 99622: I had complained last week about my car being hit - do you expect us to give all evidence when there is not even cc camera on cross street? Should  we be awake 24 hrs and note  down numbers and all?

Security is as usual helpless and clueless on this case
6/28/23, 9:45 AM - JRVenu: Hi Everyone... wanted to share some info on this topic. Speeding at the gate is something that the security can oversee... other locations is an issue.

Also.. we were looking at speed breakers as a possible solution.  But when the input from residents is sought from residents.. there was a strong push back for speedbumps as this will be difficult for kids cycling and other activities.

Convex mirrors and posting speed li.its works for visitor and vendors.. the issue is with residents speeding. 

The speeding issue is a serious one and so we need suggestions... 
Maybe not in groups.. but 1-on-1 to Raj or Nidhi or Myself.
6/28/23, 10:23 AM - JRThyagaraj111: Please co-ordinate with the  Estate manager to find

6/28/23, 10:36 AM - +91 86609 99622: That’s what I did and there is no progress, what is the resolution? Just posting something here without resolution does not make sense
6/28/23, 10:40 AM - JRThyagaraj111: If no CCTV coverd including your own cctv. Security or EM can't help. 
U can file hit and run case and work with the cops.
6/28/23, 10:45 AM - +91 86609 99622: Thanks for the suggestion, either way we have to take care of our own is what I’m hearing, very responsible answer
6/28/23, 10:46 AM - +91 78292 99422: But posting here does increase awareness. I read the message n reiterated to our driver on speed limit n safety. Not that it is a resolution but nonetheless
6/28/23, 10:48 AM - Bhagavan: Hi All, please work with Estate Manager or others to find suitable solution on this topic 

Discussion on WhatsApp doesn't yield any results rather it becomes an arguments
6/28/23, 10:50 AM - +91 86609 99622: Sorry Bhagavan, there is no argument here, just shared my experience when this topic came up today. If there is no resolution we can find as a group and MC and just say follow up with estate managers it does not make any sense to report, for every issue we can’t file police complaint . As a responsible community these are something we have to come to alignment and agree especially if this issue has been there for years to my understanding.
6/28/23, 11:00 AM - Bhagavan: Agree with all your points, let's discuss with all stakeholders like EM, victims (lack of better word) and offender

.... But not in WhatsApp
6/28/23, 11:15 AM - DrArunJR: Please suggest how and when to discuss

6/30/23, 8:25 AM - +91 98805 00667: There is construction happening behind the east gate. Likely that snakes are coming from there as the number of snake sightings was very low in last 1 year.
To MC - Can we get additional reinforcement sheet fixed at the bottom of the east gate to stop snakes crawling from under the gate
6/30/23, 12:21 PM - DrArunJR: Just to update -
I have spoken with Manipal Sarjapur Road team and have requested them to have anti snake venom. They have agreed to our request and have procured 20 vials of anti snake venom.
Dose for each patient is 10-50 vials. And each vial costs about 5000.
Thanks
6/30/23, 12:51 PM - +91 96631 79336: Thanks a lot Arun. Highly appreciate your efforts for  taking precautionary measures. If possible, could you please also share some sort of guidelines which need to be followed if someone gets bitten by snake. Over internet there is lot of do/don't buy not sure which is recommended.

6/30/23, 5:10 PM - +91 98805 00667: Question to security MC - when does the PH3 security “operationally” integrate with ph-1/2 security? 
Ph-3 main gate is mostly open with no control in place and with residents coming to live in ph-3, the small gate for park entry is also open for most of the day- this is a security concern IMO
It will be good if ph-3 main gate also gets operationally managed by our security supervisor with mygate access etc in place

7/5/23, 2:24 PM - JRSvJayaram: Generally we are using phorate  powder in some areas (JR store compound side area and back gate).
Its foul smell and allergic  issues.
So we are not using regularly this powder  to avoid any health issues

7/10/23, 6:32 PM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents
Based on the recommendation from the Vendors  , we are going to use the phorate for Snake repellant.
We are going to spray it tonight at 8 pm for common areas/ park along with the compound wall sides and empty sites.
Requesting  Residents not to send kids and pets above  mentioned areas.
Fyki
Thanks
7/10/23, 6:36 PM - +91 98805 00667: Shud we first do it on plots where ppl are living else snakes will move from empty plots to plots where there is no phorate - will increase risk
7/10/23, 6:37 PM - +91 98805 00667: Or do everything together
7/10/23, 6:50 PM - +91 96633 05410: I agree. Spray on only empty plots looks like inviting more trouble.
7/10/23, 6:53 PM - JRSvJayaram: Noted .
Also if rain continue , impact is less.
Once rain stopped we will spray first empty sites .
Thanks
7/10/23, 6:56 PM - JRVenu: Please note... phorate has a very strong odour. If you put it in your plot... it might be very hard to stay around the place
7/10/23, 8:09 PM - +91 96633 05410: Ohk ..Then what are the options we have ? Vivek has raised a valid point. As it is, there is no dearth of snakes roaming around. And with this spray, we are forcing them to head to non- sprayed areas.
7/10/23, 8:12 PM - JRVenu: I am open to all suggestions
7/10/23, 8:14 PM - +91 98863 96197: I would suggest to do a trial in a smaller public area to check how bad it is , or can we live with the inconvenience in a safer interest ( with lower quantities) . Are there other repellent options ?
7/10/23, 10:53 PM - +91 98805 00667: well odour is subjective - Afaik, is is as good or as bad as odor from natural fertilizer though a different kind of odour

7/12/23, 3:34 PM - OwnerRajeshJRG: Hi all, 

Request you to please take care of your kids who are coming back to JR from the school. Our main gate has become an hotspot for accidents since Harvest, DPS and other school buses have been diverted through the phase3 gate. 

The drivers are reckless as soon as they pass the last speed breaker opp to Ahad they overtake in a very high speed and in spite of our security been deployed they have become helpless to cross the kids to our main gate because of overspending of the buses. 

Today there was an very close encounter with one of our kid from JR when tried to cross the road without seeing the other vehicle overtaking the bus, luckily security grabbed the bag and pulled her back. 

Disclaimer: The intention of the above message is to create awareness within the parents and no intend of creating fear among anyone in the society. Thanks
7/12/23, 3:43 PM - +91 72594 37677: Completely agree!
What solution can we come up with regarding this ?
I have seen kids crossing roads without seeing either side ..can prove to be really dangerous !
7/12/23, 3:45 PM - +91 98105 83337: 100% aligned with Rajesh. This isn't and should not be considered as a thorough fair. Buses from Harvest and DPS that don't even drop here too are passing from this internal road. I too witnessed this and just yesterday night I was explaining to both kids about the Do's and Don't s. We should reach out to both these schools to amend their routes. Buses that drop here should only ply on this route. Happy to be a part of this team to take it up with these schools.
7/12/23, 3:46 PM - +91 98105 83337: Let's form a group of volunteers and reach out to these schools first. I hope they will understand. If not then reach out to the police/traffic police etc....
7/12/23, 4:29 PM - JRVenu: Thanks Rajesh for sharing your thoughts.  I think the team of volunteers should engage with Ahad MC, Security team, and the schools to drive awareness and come up with a solution that will ensure that no unfortunately incidents happens.  Will see if we can have someone from MC to be part of the team to help coordinate.
7/12/23, 7:46 PM - JRSvJayaram: No rain today.
We will do it tonight after 8 pm.
7/13/23, 6:50 AM - +91 98865 51312: I am curious where do we repel the snakes from and where do we repel them to? If we spray it in common areas and residences, where will snakes go to? Come on driveway? Or somehow escape to neighbouring land? What happen to snakes which were inside the park and now surrounded by repellent? Where would they escape? Can someone enlighten pls?

Dear Residents,
In recent days , we have  found and noticed that security has caught many snakes in our layout . MC has decided to call a snake expert for awareness about snakes and to take precautionary steps etc.
Mr. Prithvi, a snake expert, with extensive knowledge about all types of Venomous and Non Venomous  snakes, has agreed to visit our layout on Saturday, 22nd July at 4pm.
We are arranging the session in the club house at 4pm and it should finish by 5.30pm.

All residents are requested to attend the session make use of this training.

7/27/23, 10:09 AM - JRVenu: Dear Owners and Residents,

One of the areas that we are always trying to keep a close eye on is the safety and security of our community.  As part of this process, we are pleased to inform you that we have a new security vendor that will be taking charge from 27th July 2023.

This update will give us a fresh team with new outlook and ideas on how to keep our community safer. It will hopefully also address some of the  security issues that few of the residents faced in the last few months.

A few things that we wanted to share about the transition:
1. All the team members have been interviewed individually and screened for their roles.
2. Both the supervisors have been interviewed and selected by the estate-manager and a couple of MC members.
3. The new team has been trained on the MyGate system.
4. The new team has been trained on the SOP (standard operating procedure) that we have put in place for their daily duties.

The new team will try to ramp-up as quickly as possible, but it would be greatly appreciated if all of you can lend your support to them and the estate manager during this transition phase.

We will ask the supervisors to spend some time to familiarize themselves to each of you when they come across you.  So, please do spend a few seconds to introduce yourself to the team.

Please keep an eye out for changes/new security measures that we would be taking as part of this process.

Thank you all and have a great day.

On behalf of MC, JRGSHOA

8/21/23, 8:18 PM - +91 98105 83337: Hi, We are experiencing an extremely foul smell, quite similar to a dead animal at 166. Started a couple of days back but is at its peak today and stepping out of home is very difficult. Is anyone else experiencing the same. Looks like it is outside the JR boundary next to our home/phase 2. It can be injurious hence checking.
8/21/23, 8:33 PM - +91 98459 75921: Not sure if this is some burning of waste happening.

8/23/23, 7:50 PM - PoornaJr127: It is a concern that someone books an Uber cab using our home 127

I rejected the entry  in MyGate and requested security to check  actual villa number.

When Uber driver calls for pickup … the customer says doesn’t  know his villa number 

Even After making driver wait for about 15 minutes customer doesn’t show up and then cancels the trip.

Request all to 
please check before approving  any entry in MyGate to ensure safety of our community 

Thank you

Cycle repair and service camp is today from 12noon to 6pm.

Their repair canopy would most likely be set up just outside the JRG main gate so that other neighbouring apartments can see and avail their services (otherwise they won't be able to, if it's inside JRG).

Note: Diagnostics and minor repairs would be on the spot. Major repairs and overhaul would be taken up in their shop - for which they have agreed to give free pickup and drop for the cycles from JRG.

Dear Residents - I take fitness classes in clubhouse and for the purpose of music, I use portable speaker (see pic below). Because it's bulky, I keep it at the security counter (at GF entrance). I kept it this Wednesday morning but didn't find it on Friday morning. The security guards tried to find it but without success. I am dropping this msg to see if you have seen this portable speaker anywhere. Please DM me. Thanks, Megha!

Thanks to Mr Jayaram for finding it. However, the team hasn't been able to figure out who did it and why. I am concerned that this can happen again and I've dropped an email to MC with some of my observations. I would like to thank fellow residents for your support over the last few days.

8/29/23, 8:56 PM - +91 90080 60684: ASD is as per consumption if your bill goes higher then ASD also will be higher. It is equivalent to 2 months bill.

8/30/23, 8:06 PM - +91 98801 52162: Hi, Of late lot of our deliveries etc end up going to phase 3 where apparently there's another villa 2 now! Rather than expecting all the old residents to update their address in various records isnt it simpler to use a new series for the new phase villas? Just wondering 🤔
8/30/23, 8:25 PM - +91 91485 97676: Villa 2 in phase 3 is still under construction 🙂 

Also I presume your villa address would prefix with phase NUMBERS 1/2 as per the registration records?
8/30/23, 9:08 PM - +91 98801 52162: The delivery from neighborhood shop had gone to phase 3 and this is the second time it happened. Also on another instance security was repeatedly asking which phase villa2 are we 😅.  None of our registration records mention any phase no (they mention survey no).  Not sure about others, but we haven't mentioned any phase no in our address  so far anywhere
8/30/23, 9:09 PM - +91 98801 52162: Once more houses get occupied there can be confusion if this villa numbering overlaps!
8/30/23, 9:19 PM - +91 91485 97676: Our registration records shows Phase 3 and  villa numbers.  I don't think we can do anything about this other than updating phase numbers in delivery address
8/30/23, 9:22 PM - +91 96633 05410: Agree with you. When phase 1 were registered, there was no view of having similar numbered villa in phase 3 and hence none of our registered address have Phase 1. 
We also have similar challenge as yours and can understand the pain. It should be the same for residents of those villas in phase 3 as well, as mostly the  courier guys do not notice the phase but deliver based on villa no. 
Phase 2 numbering was in sequence with Phase 1 but not sure why there was a different approach taken for phase 3. However, I understand that since registration is already done based on these numbers, it cannot be changed for Phase 3.
8/30/23, 9:25 PM - +91 91485 97676: Infact I had to quarrel with Big basket 😀 since my items shown delivered but we never received and seems got delivered in phase 1/2
8/30/23, 9:27 PM - +91 77383 87842: Just a suggestion. In Google Maps, there are 2 locations for JR where Ahad road means Phase 1 & 2 whereas Hadosiddapura means Phase 3.
We started using the 2nd one and our courier issues got sorted.
You guys may try updating the map locations accordingly.
8/30/23, 10:09 PM - +91 97405 83964: Since there is no response to this msg, I am tempted to enjoy these sweets.

8/31/23, 9:56 AM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents 
Important Update on our Borewells:-
1. Phase-1 Borewell-
For the last two days, we noticed that the water flow pressure is very low. The water yield is drastically reduced. The main reason for less yield due to the digging of unlimited Borewells near our lay out.
2.Phase-2 Borewell-
From Tuesday, the phase 2 Borewell has not been working and there is a motor problem. The Vendor for the Motor lifting vehicle is coming today to remove the pipes and motor / pump from the Borewell.
In view of the above , Request Residents minimize the usage of water and if there is any leakage in flush and taps etc please report or register the complaints at the earliest.
Fyki & co-operate ,
Thanks

9/8/23, 8:15 PM - +91 98188 13370: Sir, we found a baby snake resting on the road near villa 163, immediately called gate to come n catch. Gaurds left immd from gate.

While  all this I was trying to keep an eye on the snake so that it doesn't get lost in the grass.

Called gate also twice in meanwhile, they said gaurds left immd.

In meanwhile, snake rested in the middle of road played around with the grass try to climb tree twice had lot of fun in the grass playing around. Then a relaxed crawl on the pavement 

Finally our gairds arrived walking casually, it took them decent 20-25 minutes just to reach there

By that time they reach, few seconds before snake went under some tiles lying behind that villa.

And they could not locate it.
9/8/23, 8:17 PM - +91 98188 13370: 1 - all nearby resident pls be watchful, snake looks cute n  innocent but i dont know what breed it was :)
9/8/23, 8:18 PM - +91 98188 13370: 2- pls ask gaurds to come running, treating it as emergency. As we don't know in what situation, the callar might be calling for help.
9/8/23, 8:23 PM - +91 97418 32223: Interesting and funny read :) Snake spotting is common towards the end of Phase 2. Thanks for letting us know, reminds us that we need to be extra watchful.

9/13/23, 12:14 PM - JRDeepaliNaveen: Jam towards Sarjapur ORR junction starting from Salarpuria sanctity , please plan accordingly if possible
9/13/23, 2:27 PM - +91 98801 52162: @919886680614 @919945424505 we need a better solution for this overlapping villa number confusion across old and new phases of JR Greenwich
9/13/23, 2:52 PM - +91 77383 87842: I think that Educating the security guards for validating the address and removing auto approved vendors should help here.
As neither old nor new villa numbers can be changed due to various government ID proofs.
9/13/23, 2:53 PM - +91 77383 87842: Any better suggestions except changing numbers can be discussed
9/13/23, 3:01 PM - +91 98182 82264: Add phases like 
villa no 2, phase 3, JR Greenwich
9/13/23, 3:03 PM - +91 90080 60684: Even with that things are getting delivered to wrong phase
9/13/23, 3:04 PM - JRNiranjan: As indicated by few residents above, following two points;

1) Including Phase-1 / 2 / 3 / 4 as applicable in the official address to online vendors for communication going forward by all the residents. 

2) Briefing Security guards at the entrance about which phase deliveries to be allowed.
9/13/23, 3:05 PM - JRNiranjan: Also, Mygate is enabled for phase-1,2,3. Hence Mygate approval by residents for all their online deliveries to be made mandatory.
9/13/23, 3:10 PM - +91 99596 16974: Enabling MyGate will defiantly help
9/13/23, 3:15 PM - +91 90080 60684: Looks like it is not enabled??
9/13/23, 3:16 PM - +91 99596 16974: best to my knowledge, yes, it's not yet enabled
9/13/23, 3:18 PM - JRVenu: Hi folks... just wanted to reinterate a couple of points.  In all delivery addresses going forward, we need to include PHASE.  I am sure majority of the current delivery addresses do not mention it.
The security guards are told about Phase 1 vs Phase 3 and they ask... but if the delivery address does not include PHASE details, then they will not be able to direct properly.
MyGate is enabled for all 3 phases... I have personally approved all of the villas in Phase 3 (if any not included, please work with Jayaram to register... I will approve the registrations)
9/13/23, 3:18 PM - JRVenu: My 2 cents...
9/13/23, 3:20 PM - JRVenu: @917022317048 please ensure that the security staff cross checks the PHASE and the name of the resident so that they can direct the delivery folks properly
9/13/23, 3:26 PM - +91 77383 87842: We would need to give MyGate app device to security guards at Phase 3 too for proper functioning of points mentioned by Mr. Venu.
9/13/23, 3:28 PM - +91 99596 16974: agree, we have to have him make an entry for approval
9/13/23, 3:33 PM - JRVenu: @919886680614 Maybe something we can talk this weekend?
9/13/23, 3:37 PM - +91 98801 52162: Bank a/c / passport address depends on adhaar. And adhaar address doesn't have phase no for all old residents. Its not easy to go and change in all various places now
9/13/23, 3:38 PM - +91 98801 52162: I am more concerned about missing bank card deliveries and such things than about online orders. Online orders is a smaller problem
9/13/23, 3:39 PM - +91 98801 52162: But this was a very apparent issue to be expected.. why couldn't this be avoided in the first place? I am curious.. (pardon my ignorance here!)
9/13/23, 3:48 PM - +91 98801 52162: If my above question is something to be not discussed in this forum, i request someone please educate me on DM 😅
9/13/23, 3:50 PM - +91 90080 60684: Your question can only be answered by Niranjan 😊
9/13/23, 3:54 PM - +91 98801 52162: Ok.. i am waiting 🙏
9/13/23, 4:09 PM - JRNiranjan: Yes Sir, let’s close on it. As discussed we’ll have security agency replaced on Phase-3 to the ones in Phase-1 for better coordination
9/13/23, 4:11 PM - +91 98802 06248: Can we use  301, 302 etc ...  and 401, 402 etc. For Phase-4 (should the same problem exist there) ... nothing changes on Official records
9/13/23, 4:12 PM - +91 77383 87842: This message was deleted
9/13/23, 4:12 PM - JRNiranjan: Only if BDA engineers thought as much Madam. They didn’t agree for reasons best they know. 

Phase-4 they agreed :). Starts from 300 onwards.
9/13/23, 4:12 PM - +91 77383 87842: I am sure that these will get fixed without changing anything if MyGate approvals are made mandatory and security checks for phase and name of the resident before allowing.
9/13/23, 4:16 PM - +91 90080 60684: Wasn’t aware that they had a say in internal Numbering of plots
9/13/23, 4:17 PM - +91 98801 52162: I seriously hope you are right! I am not taking on the tasks of updating our Adhaar, Passport, bank, investments etc etc.
9/13/23, 4:22 PM - +91 77383 87842: We phase 3 members are adding “Phase 3” in all addresses. So if security guards are educated well, it shouldn’t be a problem
9/13/23, 7:24 PM - +91 98807 12711: Anyone coming via hsr to jr now please let me know
9/13/23, 7:58 PM - +91 95912 42492: How is the  condition of the access to JRG from Sarjapur road? Is it flooded?

9/14/23, 9:54 AM - +91 90080 60684: In 4th cross calls won’t work unless you use wifi calling and connect to wifi.
9/14/23, 9:55 AM - +91 98105 83337: Yes in 2nd cross too, same issue.

Talking only of JRG, the fruit-bats are often in clusters in the empty plots after #96.

Since dogs have the tendencies to sniff/lick   smells, it's best advised to pet-parents to avoid such zones (where bats are often seen) - just to be extra-cautious.

https://chng.it/5Tvrdqt8Xc
9/22/23, 9:14 AM - +91 96505 91118: Well we all fully support but I don't understand how we signing will impact or will change things. There are many such initiatives over change.org
9/22/23, 9:30 AM - +91 98802 06248: Hi Vikram, some of the measures this team has taken includes meeting with D K Suresh and the MLA for this constituency to build visibility on this and ask for support and engagement.

I am myself skeptical of these online petitions and initiatives ... but it is still worth the try. Any other way we can join hands ??
9/22/23, 10:38 AM - +91 96505 91118: Thanks Ananth. Good to know that everyone want this to be sorted. I will sign off this petition for sure
The only way to get this sorted is to keep the continuous  dialog with MLA and agree on timelines. The more people join hands and come over for meetings with MLA, the better it will be.
9/22/23, 10:39 AM - +91 96505 91118: Happy to help anytime

Also on a side note, using the rest room before one leaves office is a good thing to do. In other news comedian Trevor Noah is playing today at blr, guess the joke was on bangalore and it’s comical traffic situation.

9/30/23, 9:44 AM - +91 98801 52162: What nonsense!
9/30/23, 10:11 AM - JRSrini: Looks like they are regulating private apps that are using private vehicles for commercial purposes. It will be good if they come up with a solution rather than banning.

No other car pooling is restricted.
9/30/23, 10:27 AM - +91 98801 52162: Quickride and such apps are great initiatives.. rather than come up with ways to regulate them banning them is outright regressive
9/30/23, 10:29 AM - +91 96505 91118: This seems to me is purely driven by taxi lobby who are suffering because of car pooling.
Must have paid politicians for this action.

This initiative is by *SoS - Save our Sarjapura Road - Fix the Traffic*. We are a coalition of local *volunteers from Bellandur Forum, Iblur Env Trust, Kasavanahalli Development Forum, and Bangalore Apartment Federation and other residents*
 We will use the information to support the demand for better transport solutions -- including better bus routes and schedules, shuttles/feeder options, support for cyclists, better footpaths etc.

We will also be working with the Personal to Public (P2P) campaign by WRI, ORRCA and others. Along with demand for buses, we are also lobbying for better footpath and safer junctions.

Hello All,
Is anyone facing issues with lost or misplaced clothes after giving to Devendra (our ironing man) in recent times?

I am unable to trace something after rigorous attempts at home. By eliminations, I am only left with one option that may be it has never come back from Devendra and never noticed it in the lst 2-3 weeks.

But before asking him, I thought of checking here. There is always a chance that he has sent my stuff to someone else in JRG!

I have been a member at Cult since mid-2014 and have enjoyed every session there … well almost 😊… till I ran into some issues with my back. I have decided to pause for now due to repeated injuries, .. but however have an existing membership till Dec 2024. 

I have seen a lot of JRG members at the Doddakaneli centre, and in case there is someone still sitting on the fence, I am allowed to transfer it to anyone who may be interested .. so if you are looking for a Healthy New Year Resolution.. do reach out to me.

Cheers,
Ananth

12/15/23, 12:12 PM - +91 98801 52162: Hi, Any idea on typical charges for water softener resin change? Arun (contact shared earlier here) has quoted 25k for 100 ltr foodgrade resin + 5k for AMC. Total 30k. Incurring this sort of expense for the first time after installation 5 yrs ago. Hence felt it is good to validate here first
12/15/23, 12:30 PM - +91 98801 52162: Also would help if anyone who newly got water softener installed can share what the cost was
12/15/23, 2:01 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: I have got it changed last year ..i remember paying 30k and he has not given me that part of money will go as AMC .   It will be good to know what AMC covers??

12/15/23, 4:12 PM - +91 98801 52162: 😐 and i closed the deal at 24k for "food grade" resin - purple color.. whatever that means.. thinking i was getting a fair deal
12/15/23, 4:13 PM - +91 98801 52162: Didnt go for AMC.. 400Rs per visit monthly maintenance to be paid per visit
12/15/23, 4:14 PM - +91 98801 52162: Thanks for sharing.. may be useful for those looking to change resin in future!

Dear JRG Residents,
It's about time for us to refresh the vehicle stickers in our community. Starting today, 23rd December, we will be issuing the new stickers to every resident in this community. 

To facilitate this distribution & register each vehicle owned by the residents/owners in our community in the MyGate application, we would need a copy of the vehicle Registration Card (RC). 

Please send a copy of the RC document to jrg.estatemanager@gmail.com along with your villa number at your earliest opportunity. Should the residents own more than one vehicle in their name, please send the RC copy of the other vehicles too. 

Upon receipt of this RC document, one of our JRG staff will visit your villa, take a picture of the vehicle, complete registration of the vehicle in the MyGate application, and issue the stickers at your villa.

Last date to refresh your vehicle sticker would be 14th Jan 2024.

Should you need any further clarifications, please reach out to JRG Association.

Thank you for your attention.

12/28/23, 3:09 PM - JRVenu: Dear Friends,

It is the time of the year when we starting planning for Sankranthi 2024.  This year we are planning to have it on 14th January (Sunday).  Like always we will make it a celebration to remember with traditional food, cooking of Pongal, and some great fun time.

We are planning to start early in the morning with Bhoghi (traditional bonfire) and end it with lunch.  The initial plan is…
•	Bhoghi fire
•	Cooking Pongal
•	Breakfast
•	Games and fun time
•	Lunch
Not to forget the traditional attire (both ladies and gents).

A few of us (some from the sub-committee and additional volunteers) have formed a core team.  Hoping that more people will join the core team to plan the event, and lot of participation as aways from the community.

Please start looking out for more communication from the team.  As always any ideas and suggestions are always welcome.
12/28/23, 3:24 PM - +91 98860 44493: Superb, it will be nice to meet the residents. Looking forward 😊

We are less than a week away from Sankranthi.  We have started the preparations and hoping to make it an exciting Sankranthi 2024.

To start the whole process we have prepared a *Sign-up sheet* (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YHwZsjg3Mst1ogIFGnt2O_XM7WodXGillzllqoCuE9M/edit#gid=0) for each of you to let us know the events you will participate (especially the breakfast, Pongal, and lunch).  This will help us plan the quantities and ensure that everyone has their filling of traditional Sankranthi food and fun.

Request everyone to give us a count (by villa) for number of adults and kids at the earliest.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YHwZsjg3Mst1ogIFGnt2O_XM7WodXGillzllqoCuE9M/edit#gid=0

1/15/24, 10:36 AM - JRVenu: Dear Friends,
Hope everyone had a good time at the Sankranthi celebrations.  The organizing team has thoroughly loved the fact that so many of the community joined the event.
One last closing item is the payments for the events. Based on all the registrations/participations and the cost of various items, we calculated the below to be our cost for the Sankranthi celebrations.

	Adults
Breakfast	190
Lunch	365
	
	Kids
Breakfast	135
Lunch	225
--Above amounts include the common expenses and the respective food costs
We would greatly appreciate if you can GPAY or PhonePe the respective amounts for your family to Madhuri Reddy or SriLakshmi at the below numbers.
GPAY – 8971867277 (Madhuri Reddy)
PhonePe – 9902246847 (SriLakshmi Pulavarthi)

Example of your villas 3 adults and 2 kids that joined for breakfast and 2 adults and 2 kids that joined for lunch.  Your payment will be (3 x 190) + (2x135) + (2x365) + (2x225) = 380+270+730+450=1,830.

*PS: Once payment is made can you update the registration sheet with “GPayed (PhonePed) from number x123456789”?  Helps us to keep track of transfers.*

Regards,
Organizing team

 *When* : 21st Jan, Sunday, 4pm to 5.30pm

 *Where* : #145, JR Greenwich, Off Sarjapur Road, Near Wipro Office.

🍃 why a whole plant based diet is healthier and safer today, 

🍃 the scientific research that links positive disease management with a plant based diet,

🍃 the restorative effect of the plant based diet that works as a preventive measure,

🍃 how a whole plant based diet improves our immunity significantly.

1/19/24, 6:46 PM - +91 95912 42492: Hi all,
Many residents have expressed interest in contributing Prasad for 22nd January event . 
Hence we have created a WhatsApp group  for those interested in contributing to Mahaprasad instead of individual offering. This will help avoid repetition of prasad  items and  wastage of food  and disposables. 
Please join the group if you plan to contribute to the MahaPrasad

1/19/24, 10:39 PM - JRVenu: Dear Friends,

When we started tallying the expenses for Sankranthi we accidentally left out a couple of line items.  Unfortunately, the amount is large enough that we had to recalculate the charges and come back to you for reimbursement.

In the spreadsheet below we have calculated the difference between the new charges and the amount already paid by each villa.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n6pbtp4yrRnhvhwNhrYm37R7L2m9Eq0E-4-tOvS3pzY/edit#gid=0

Sorry for the confusion and inconvenience due to the oversight, but I am sure you will understand and support us by making the transfer to Venu Reddy (8105152164) at the earliest.

PS: Please mark PAID next to each of your respective villa after the transfer is made.

1/27/24, 2:41 PM - JrSrilakshmi: Hello Friends,

Neeraj (#71) and me had gone to Kodathi Gram Panchayat president to meet her for our external road work and potholes filling. Because of land owner issue at the hospital road entry, complete road work and drainage connect can't be done. However she had agreed to do the baby step of doing the concrete filling at the junction. At this junction, the craters were quite deep and had witnessed a few accidents especially with 2 wheelers. With our follow-ups, today they have at least did concrete filling in these craters. Just wanted to share this update with you guys. Even though the work done is still of mediocre quality, however some temporary respite, it shall provide. Next step would be to get the cleaning of bushes and filling all the potholes. 
Attaching few photos of the location.

1/27/24, 9:14 PM - JrSrilakshmi: Dear Friends,

When we started tallying the expenses for Sankranthi we accidentally left out a couple of line items.  Unfortunately, the amount is large enough that we had to recalculate the charges and come back to you for reimbursement.

In the spreadsheet below we have calculated the difference between the new charges and the amount already paid by each villa.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n6pbtp4yrRnhvhwNhrYm37R7L2m9Eq0E-4-tOvS3pzY/edit#gid=0

Sorry for the confusion and inconvenience due to the oversight, but I am sure you will understand and support us by making the transfer to Venu Reddy (8105152164) at the earliest.

PS: Please mark PAID next to each of your respective villa after the transfer is made.

Regards,

2/3/24, 10:21 PM - JRNiranjan: Dear Residents,

Good evening ! Hope this message finds you in good spirits.

Today I’m saddened to put my plots at Phase-1 up for sale with a heavy heart. Unfortunately the main culprit being the 8 storied  illegal and unauthorised structures that have come up on the eastern boundary of Phase-1 taking away much of the privacy and adoration with which this community was built. 

I sincerely and humbly request the residents of JR Greenwich to not support such reckless developments by investing in such blatant PG schemes, during and post development of which will take away much of the peace and serenity of its surroundings.

I learnt that some of the investors are now part of the Managing Committee of our Association. 

I kindly request the members of this prestigious community to insist them to leave the MC posts in our welfare Association voluntarily as their biases and interests wouldn’t augur well for a well structured community like JR Greenwich. 

Appreciate your understanding of concerns as a developer of this vibrant community 🙏🏼

2/5/24, 11:26 PM - +91 97405 83964: Dear Residents,

Good Evening !  Hope this message finds you all in good spirits.

I have decided to send my resignation to the association secretary by tomorrow morning.  My integrity as the president of the association has been questioned and hence this decision. And since I will always be questioned about my intent in future, it will be best to resign from my position as president.

Yes, I do have an investment for a fraction of land plot in the adjacent layout and I do not accept unsolicited advice for my investment choices.

President or no president, as always I will continue to work for the betterment of JRG.

-Regards,
Neeraj Garg

3/4/24, 6:14 PM - +91 99459 37777: @917022317048 — can you please update on the tanker situation? 

1. How many coming per week now, versus last year? 
2. ⁠what are the Tanker charges this year (hearing very steep prices from news) 
3. ⁠how’s the JRG ground water level doing as per our borewells?
3/5/24, 8:42 AM - JrSrilakshmi: We are assessing the our borewell water situation and will publish a report.  Things are  dynamic and everyone has to be cautious and use water judiciously.  Some tips that can help
1. Postpone the tank cleanings to after summer time.
2. Check your aerators in wash basin taps. 
3. Check the leakages from flush. (Abhijit can help).  
4. Reuse your RO waste water to water your plants
5. Stop washing your cars with water (wiping is better).
6.   Reduce the usage of flush, use mug of water where possible.

3/5/24, 10:42 AM - +91 96324 79094: RO filter sends 3L down the drain, for every 1L of filtered water.
Last year, as part of Project Hydrate, Medhansh (my son) installed a solution in multiple houses in JRG for effective collection and reuse of that water. - https://medhanshgarg29.wixsite.com/hydrate
He might not be able to do that anymore, but the solution is extremely simple.
Install a big blue drum in your utility, to collect water, a submersible motor, a hose pipe into your garden.
If there is a need for making a small hole in your kitchen window for the outlet of drainage pipe, Avijit can do that.
Reach out to me if any questions

3/5/24, 2:40 PM - +91 98860 44493: Hi looking for a maid  for washing vessels and sweeping cleaning. 
If you know of anyone please ping me. 9886044493. Villa 48. 
Also what is the rate or fees we are offering here? 
Some are asking for an exorbitant amount.
3/5/24, 6:09 PM - +91 98801 52162: Very simple solution to RO refuse water reuse is to lead the refuse pipe to a bucket and use that water for mopping, washing vessels, car. Also dont keep the RO filter ON always.. switch on only when both filtered water tank and refuse water bucket are empty to take more water. This way you can ensure there is no waste water run off.
We have been doing this for 15 years now, haven't observed any degradation in shine of flooring or vessels.
3/5/24, 6:31 PM - JRDeepaliNaveen: Another option.. redirect it to your ground floor tank. Proportion of this to fresh water is not much and hence not much of difference in water quality and is more hassle free.. needs pipe cleaning or replacement on a periodic basis.
3/5/24, 7:11 PM - +91 73959 78103: Can this refuse water be used for watering plants?
3/5/24, 7:14 PM - +91 90080 60684: Yes but how much.. for every litre the RO throws 3-4 litres
3/5/24, 7:28 PM - +91 73959 78103: Atleast some we can. We have a seperate sump for collecting rain water which we use for these activities. If RO refuse can be used, ee can redirect it to the sump too
3/5/24, 7:47 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: We transfer the water to toilet and use this water instead of flush.   And also use the water for vessels cleaning, moping and gardening.
3/6/24, 9:27 AM - +91 96324 79094: Can we send an official directive from association to not clean porch and car with hosepipe directly.
Just today morning, I saw car being cleaned by hose pipe.
It is likely that owners do not even know that their staff is doing that, so owners should inform their staff too
3/6/24, 9:30 AM - +91 96324 79094: yes, I have been doing that for years, infact used it for cleaning moping everything,
Its perfectly good water
3/6/24, 9:56 AM - +91 98801 52162: On the same topic, but a different note, way back in 2018 few owners of phase 1&2 and the association took initiative to build about 20(?) rainwater recharge wells.. each household spending some 20k or more as a community initiative to help improve the water table of area in general without any direct / immediate benefit to the people investing in it. It was a voluntary initiative. Now while phase 3&4 construction is going on, @919886680614 what are the initiatives from builder's side to tackle the water situation in new phases? Is it possible to plan recharge pits at community level at phase 3&4?
3/6/24, 10:00 AM - +91 98801 52162: And also we used to have the practise of water consumption at each villa level being noted and published to owners. That would be useful to know again now in these times, atleast for a few months till each resident gets a chance to note, reflect and make amends
3/6/24, 10:04 AM - JrSrilakshmi: 1. **Some residents doesn't have auto controller to automatically off when overhead tank is full which may waste lot of water. Better to fix it.* 
2. *Use mop while cleaning portico (car parking area) instead of hose pipe or bucket of water*

Added 2 more points by residents suggestions 👆
3/6/24, 10:11 AM - +91 78292 99422: Also those water reducers were fixed for most villas a few years back, when we came here, we had to specifically ask Jayram n get them installed. So for all new comers it is worthwhile to check if taps have reducers fit

3/9/24, 7:12 PM - +91 78292 99422: In light of the latest water situation n measures taken by the community, will Holi festivities be allowed? Even a dry one? Who decides? MC? Cultural committee or vote by residents?
3/9/24, 11:48 PM - +91 90080 60684: We should do dry Holi this time
3/9/24, 11:49 PM - DrArunJR: Dry holi this year is no brainer. Still same fun and dance and masti...
3/10/24, 12:07 AM - +91 78292 99422: Absolutely! Music dance meeting friends n festivities ought to continue. May be we should try no color holi Or limit the color play as washing common areas n washing off the color will consume more water. Of  course this is if others agree
3/10/24, 7:35 AM - +91 98863 96197: I am looking for a cook , if anyone knows a cook looking for work , let me know .
3/10/24, 9:49 AM - JrPrashanth: Check with security guards once also
3/10/24, 10:57 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Good morning, during the very first term of our association operations, few of us from the MC spent considerable time to elicit water conservation best practices implemented by RWAs around.   Biome, an organisation dedicated to ecology & environment was driving a city- wide recharge wells target & other water conservation techniques in Bangalore. Santosh ( Villa 45) and I attended a session by them at Rainbow Drive, which included a demo of water conservation initiatives implemented by the RWA there. Further to this, as many of you know, we went ahead with digging 8 large recharge wells in our common areas (funded from the association pool) and increasing the depth of existing recharge pits in 29 individual villas ( funded by the individual owners who volunteered for the cause). To summarise our efforts, Biome came out with this documentary, which should work as a refresher to all who were present in JRG back then and a ready reckoner for people who moved in later.

3/10/24, 11:10 AM - JrAditya: Very inspiring and heartiest congratulations to all involved in driving this agenda. 💐
Great work by all households to reduce and reuse the water.🙏
3/10/24, 11:15 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Before we implemented these recharge pits, I have seen how our borewells used to go near empty by March . The yield has been good during the last 4 summers post recharge and only now, i understand one is almost dry and the other is going through existence crisis. Not to discount the ill effect of 40 borewells right outside our eastern boundary wall. Can't think of 40 borewells in a 2 acre plot. This is where our authorities fail to control such reckless drilling, one that disturbs the groundwater table. I am not sure whether they have any recharge pits in that layout, I only see concrete jungle there!!!
3/10/24, 11:22 AM - +91 98802 06248: And have they got water in those 40 borewells ?? I would be surprised if they did. 

Unfortunately, it's only going to get worse when those  dwellings get inhabitants next year.
3/10/24, 11:25 AM - +91 73959 78103: its basically waste of money... when you drill very close to each other, you are basically getting the water from the same pool below.
3/10/24, 11:29 AM - JrGopal128Wood: Specific to water, i happened to see a billboard somewhere which read:
Quote:
Our grandparents saw water in rivers and lakes;
Our parents saw water in wells & ponds;
We saw water in pipes & mobile tankers;
Our children see water in containers and bottles;
Where will our grandchildren see ? In capsules ?

If we don't act now, they may see only in their tears !!!!!
Unquote:
I found it very relevant to what is happening now....Time for everyone to act...else, it is going to be war over water .....
3/10/24, 11:31 AM - +91 73959 78103: is it the same concrete jungle with 40 borewells owned by JR resident as niranjan pointed out?
3/10/24, 11:41 AM - +91 99808 47825: Just a thought...even now do we still have the earlier 29 villas that dug up further ? Should we not push for more across for RWH. Also at that time we had found, the existing 9 ft ones in lawn were not properly connected to RWH..we should focus on these.
3/10/24, 11:43 AM - JRSvJayaram: Dear Residents and Owners,

Tomorrow (March 11th) is the last date for the Jan- March 24  maintenance payment. Penalties would be effective for late payments. A one time fine of Rs. 500 and monthly penalty of 2% cumulative are  applicable.

Regards,
EM
On behalf of  JRGSHOA
3/10/24, 11:44 AM - +91 97405 83964: Yes only 29 had done it. There are many who didn't do this. Also the villas on rent also didn't do it. Maybe an inspection by avijit/Jairam can send a reminder/refresher to these villas.
3/10/24, 11:44 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Thank you so much for this lead effort and have right work done for this society where we sustained for the last 4 summers, but now with 40 borewells in 2 acres and each plot consists of 8 stories  buildings we r running out of water... this is even without occupancy..  will  be a nightmare  with an occupancy of 1000 heads by next summer
3/10/24, 11:48 AM - +91 99808 47825: I believe what we control, we should look for max wells in the villa lawns <This message was edited>
3/10/24, 11:49 AM - +91 98805 00667: BWSSB connection - IMO, we should also apply for that.
3/10/24, 11:53 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Can yhr association share some white paper about the water sources and consumption of min - avg - Max per house... also, the associated costs... same cost per ltr calculate for all range... any proposal to reduce the consumption...
All residents meet if it can't be shared thru white paper
3/10/24, 11:53 AM - JrAditya: Similar to reduction of water consumption, we must find ways to reduce electricity consumption too... Both at individual villa and at the society level too. 

✓ Turn off lights, ACs in the Clubhouse when no one is using the facilities.
✓ Very nice to see some owners have installed Solar Panels ... It helps not only to generate electricity but also insulates the heat to keep the top floor cool.
✓ Low cost 100% opaque roller blinds at home (especially in the west facing windows) can cool the temperatures inside thereby reducing the burden on ACs.

Remember to educate kids on conserving water and electricity - these are National Resources, and India has acute shortage of both.

I don't think I said anything new, just reiterated the points to refresh our commitment.
3/10/24, 11:54 AM - JR18Jayakumar: Hope the forecasted better  summer rain in March n April will top up the ground water level
3/10/24, 12:14 PM - +91 97405 83964: @water experts, the recharge pits which we did, does it require some kind of cleaning /inspection for maximum effectiveness? We all did this 4-5 years back, not sure if they are still good enough to recharge the ground water?
3/10/24, 12:39 PM - +91 98182 82264: Yes , you need to clean it after 3 years of interval.
3/10/24, 12:41 PM - +91 98182 82264: Also everyone can install a small tank for collecting waste water of RO in utility area. It can be used for moping, watering plants
3/10/24, 12:43 PM - JRPraveenNeighbour: SOLAR PANEL is much more beneficial for club house  where human control is less to switch off lights and per unit cost is HIGH ..We did collect some quotes from vendor but did not proceed due to other priority activities to finish first ...
3/10/24, 12:43 PM - +91 98182 82264: Or you can redirect RO waste water to recharge pit also
3/10/24, 1:22 PM - JrPrashanth: They have two models 3L/M and 1.75L/M, anyone uses 1.75 one, is it working fine for washing utensils...
3/10/24, 4:42 PM - +91 98801 52162: Last time we could get the recharge pit done in our lawn as it was a community driven effort and individual effort involved in finding the contact/negotiating separately etc were avoided. Also it came with a push where we jumped in with others and it got done. All it takes is 2 days of putting up with the mess around the lawn thats all. And yes we found that our RWH pipe was connected to drain which meant water would just flow away down the road, rather than be absorbed by the ground to increase the water table. This was fixed by connecting RWH pipe to the recharge pit. Can we take a poll how many people would be interested to join this initiative now and do another mass drive? At the same time can even plan maintenance of the earlier dug pits too. Timing the actual implementation can be planned considering all relevant factors <This message was edited>
3/10/24, 5:03 PM - JRHseOwnerJagan: We should review if all the new houses have RWH dug. We can follow up with under construction house also
3/10/24, 5:56 PM - JRRahulTaneja added +91 97423 85206
3/10/24, 9:13 PM - JrSrilakshmi: Freshly *Harvested Organic Guava* .. Order form attached link 


For the people who have joined this group recently.  These Guava are from our farm Shayani Farms and grown organic and freshly harvested. Shayani Farms is primarily a mango orchard with other fruits like  Guava, pomegranate, chikku, Jamun etc..,

Limited stock, hurry!!!

Will deliver tomorrow (11th March)

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIvBidXcFlcLSmi0bPLd67EQ7IVwZrahc2RB0S7pkVQpbd3w/viewform?usp=sharing
3/10/24, 11:23 PM - +91 98188 13370: This is good suggestion and most should put am effort to do this in their under construction villas.
3/10/24, 11:23 PM - +91 98188 13370: Also one naive question... 

If 1000 people will use more water from those plots, would it make more sense to focus a lot more on where our water actually comes.
From where we pull water that needs to be recharged.

point is if that side of water is destined to be gone anyway in some time, we should have our alternative sites be fully ready and charged more too. Means extensive recharging in arround those sites, in fact some how systematically route rain water from entire society wasted rain water to those areas recharge pits with deeper amd bigger well there.

So that, even if ground water get depleted from those plots side, we have continued water supply to society.

Experts may suggest better, as i dont completly understand how exactly the underground water flows. But this sounds logical to me.
3/11/24, 6:09 AM - Bhagavan: My reply in two parts

Theirs "1KPeople" and our water source at ground level  is same?

Stats shows it same. Reason: All 3 summers after Stage1 RWH we didn't face any crisis, before stage1 and now we are facing.

Taking suggestions by RWH experts for Stage2 of RWH.

Mr.@919972252280 reached out to the experts to do further survey.
All suggestions posted here are evaluated with them.

Interested members are welcome to join the discussions .

3/11/24, 11:45 AM - +91 96202 12548: This morning I read an article saying that the government has asked people to get permission before drilling any borewell. I wonder if these people have permission for 41 borewells. Either they are illegal or the officials are heartlessly corrupt.
3/11/24, 11:49 AM - +91 98182 82264: Every building will have borewell as they have planned. If 60 plots are there than 60 borewell will come up. This is PG's only. But ramson's is a big project, think how much water they need per day.
3/11/24, 11:51 AM - JRAnil: Any borewell to be drilled after Mar 15th has to be approved by the Govt/Local Authority. They are staying ahead of the curve!
3/11/24, 12:22 PM - +91 98802 06248: This is crazy, can we bring this to the notice of the authorities .. the Panchayat or BBMP
3/11/24, 1:57 PM - JrGopal128Wood: Are you stating this with full knowledge about this layout plan or is that a generic statement? Even if it's generic, the law states otherwise....
3/11/24, 2:16 PM - JRVenu: Oh joy.... more torture
3/11/24, 2:26 PM - JrPrashanth: Just had a conversation with a JIO engineer, they said that there is a booster tower behind Gate # 2 which is decommissioned as the land got sold and the new owner told them to remove it...

We visited the site in December,  Marketing guy told us that there will borewell in each plpt
3/11/24, 5:21 PM - +91 96631 79336: Yes it will certainly help. I received call from Jio and they allowed me talk to Network guy - Rohit who is managing electronic City Jio Network. Our area comes under electronic City.
3/11/24, 5:22 PM - JrPrashanth: Don't let them close the complaint ticket
3/11/24, 5:22 PM - +91 96631 79336: Rohit confirmed same story, new landowner switched off mobile tower and Jio doesn't have any immediate solution other than to talk to Wipro.
3/11/24, 5:23 PM - +91 96631 79336: It may take 2-3 weeks and there is no temporary solution for now.
3/11/24, 5:26 PM - +91 96631 79336: Good thing, Jio mobile tower is moveable ( not fixed), it needs only electric power to run. So if Wipro allows, it can be shifted immediately. As per Rohit, Wipro employees are also suffering and there are good chances they will allow.
3/11/24, 5:50 PM - +91 98105 83337: Hi, I am trying to make the maintenance payment on the ICICI Bank account but it was declined last week and today too. Did anyone else face the same issue.

3/14/24, 3:17 PM - +91 90080 60684: Sorry but not we, we bought authenticated properties approved by civic authorities. Problem is everyone wants to dig graves but no one wants to invest in future. Why can’t Karnataka government dig new lakes? Why can’t they control civic authorities? Because they don’t want to???
3/14/24, 4:27 PM - JRNiranjan: This message was deleted
3/14/24, 4:29 PM - JRNiranjan: Sorry to say this but out of excess greed, some very smart and intelligent people living in such approved and authenticated properties by civic agencies, are now investing in illegal and unapproved properties (read disaster jungles) adding to such woes ! Absolutely zero moral and ethical grounds. Unfortunately shooting our own 🦶 and try to make up for it by participating and contributing for other social causes and cultural celebrations. Fantastic state of affairs !
3/14/24, 4:52 PM - +91 96505 91118: On a lighter note, Do they need to dig lakes ? Come monsoon and we will be getting in JRG from other side😀😀
3/15/24, 10:48 AM - JrSrilakshmi: In addition to the points mentioned last time.

1. Water yield from phase 1 borewell is reduced by 20%
2. Negotiated with a water tanker vendor for water supply throughout the summer. 
3. Negotiated with the water supplier and agreed for a nominal increase in price.
4. Usage of swimming pool may be stopped if water crisis increases. Govt of Karnataka has made comment on usage of drinking water in swimming pool. We are reviewing that also.
5. Reduce the water usage to 600 ltr/day per villa (4 members)
6. Request to reduce water usage in terrace gardening.
7. Sump and overhead tank cleaning strictly prohibted for next 3 months.
8. Increase the usage of STP water for all common gardens.
9. Dry Holi celebration is suggested to residents.
 *Water committee is actively exploring all available options to manage the water crisis.* 

Need volunteers for the following.
1. Encouraging new/old residents for RWH pits. 
2. Organising and guiding awareness messages with children across the layout .
3/15/24, 11:05 AM - +91 96202 12548: Please share contact for RWH pit.
3/15/24, 11:05 AM - JrPrashanth: Please help to get the watering done for the common area garden with STP water with proper frequency... It is currently irregular and creates issues with potted plants. It will help if we can fix and communicate the timings...
3/15/24, 11:18 AM - Bhagavan: Thomas, FYI. 
we are planning to have more RWH points in JRG.

Along with that you can also do your RWH point.
3/15/24, 11:32 AM - JR103104Vivek: Thank you for considering more Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) points in JRG. While I'm not against RWH, I suggest evaluating options like having additional borewells or underground rainwater storage tanks. RWH mainly replenishes underground water tables, which may not directly benefit JRG. It's crucial to explore options that offer more immediate benefits.
3/15/24, 11:32 AM - +91 96202 12548: For myself 2 side areas also have garden. I never water the front lawn.
3/15/24, 11:47 AM - JRRahulTaneja: Yes, i also see stp water is being put rather erratically, we should use maximum use of stp water for watering lawns.

@917022317048, pls ensure more frequent and regular stp watering
3/15/24, 11:52 AM - JRSvJayaram: Ok noted 
STP watering days.
Wednesday
Thursday
Saturday.
Timing morning 9.30am to 6 pm.
Lunch time 1 pm to 2 pm.
Labors will start one day from main gate and they will reach 7 th cross in the evening .
2nd day they will start from 7 th cross and reach evening main gate .
3/15/24, 11:54 AM - +91 96202 12548: Can they do the side lawns as well if there is enough STP water? At least for just the summer?
3/15/24, 11:54 AM - +91 81055 66882: Isn’t it Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday? That spacing works better I feel
3/15/24, 11:57 AM - JRSvJayaram: Tying mistake , Tuesday ( not Wednesday)

3/27/24, 5:31 PM - +91 98802 06248: *Traffic Advisory: Outer Ring Road from Krishnarajapura till Central Silk Board*
ORR Metro Blue line civil work is now focussed on the construction of the various METRO STATIONS in the reach. Most of Viaduct work has been completed

The ORR Metro stations are being built with pre-cast concrete components to minimise the impact to traffic movement and also speed up the construction. However, the foundation and Pillar works would have to be done at the site and it is likely to impact traffic movement. Barricading has been widened in both Main carriageway and Service road in places where the station work has started

Currently, BMRCL is working with the target of *completing the CIVIL WORK of the stations in Phase 2A reach by DECEMBER 2024*

This would mean COMMUTE TIME would SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE in ORR from now till December 2024

Request commuters to plan for additional commute time in ORR

Pls be cautious about any calls from courier services claiming that they have parcels on ur name with drugs.. I am a victim of this scam and lost money .. <This message was edited>

4/1/24, 7:43 AM - JRHseOwnerJagan: Another scam that is going around is arrest warrant because of sending the harassing messages through SIM...
4/1/24, 7:55 AM - +91 96505 91118: How much you lost ? Did you transfer money or it went from you account. ?
4/1/24, 7:59 AM - +91 96505 91118: Use credit card for all purchases. Limited withdrawal limits on cards for online purchase and tap.
Don't keep any idle funds in bank accounts. Better put in mutual fund / liquid funds. 
If you get call, ask them to contact bank directly instead of answering any question to caller.
4/1/24, 7:59 AM - +91 98865 27761: Lost 2L and I transferred it from my account
4/1/24, 8:14 AM - +91 98865 27761: They wanted more.. but fortunate/unfortunate we identified it and stopped it there..
4/1/24, 8:21 AM - JRVenu: I got a similar call from someone who claimed to be from fedex.
Thankful I escaped the trap... I reported it to cyber crime branch.
It is scary folks... please be aware.
4/1/24, 8:22 AM - +91 97415 51437: Oh, I also received a call from DHL telling issue with my shipment at Mumbai customs last week, it was a proper IVRS call.
They asked me to get in touch with Customs before it was too late.
4/1/24, 8:22 AM - JRPraveenNeighbour: Awareness is important- I too received calls that I have some goods at custom etc. But  my friend in office narrated similar kind of story that he was being framed into these things so I just disconnected call..
4/1/24, 8:22 AM - +91 97415 51437: after a few cross questions, I told them that I will file a police complaint and you better contact my lawyer, give me your number and my lawyer will call back, post that DHL person hung up the phone.
I haven't received any call back since then.

4/1/24, 8:33 AM - +91 98802 06248: I got these calls too .. from FedEx Mumbai ..a parcel from Taiwan, they had my phone number and name ... I asked them for the Mail-from address .. it was a Mumbai address... and I told the same .. that I will need to report it to the Police .. after which there was no further communication. 

The thing is that it seems very genuine ..  with a FedEx Vaord calling number and IVR menu.
4/1/24, 8:34 AM - JRHimanshu: I m also one who rcvd this call in October month last year.
4/1/24, 8:36 AM - JrAditya: Guys, most importantly look at the URL when making a money transfer... There's very little difference to see in www.hbfcbank.com and www.hdfcbank.com
4/1/24, 8:37 AM - JrAditya: Scammers create an exact look and feel of a bank webpage and ask you to proceed with important KYC or a credit card monthly payment.
4/1/24, 9:26 AM - JrGopal128Wood: A close relative of mine received a call last week claiming to be from Jio customer service. The caller said that his SIM and Adhar have been used to procure arms and narcotics in Lucknow and he is being prosecuted by police. The caller then transferred the call claiming the person at the other end as the police officer. The other person turned on his video for a few seconds to be seen in his police uniform and a board behind him displaying UP Police.... He goes off video and says it is a serious case and an arrest warrant is out but he could help if some money is transferred. My relative told him to come to Bangalore and disconnected the call.... Sending this just to sensitize how much preparation these scamsters do to look authentic to a gullible person at the other end !!!!! The majority of the law enforcement staff being busy in election preparations, scams of all types might come hitting hard.... Wise would be to have Truecaller installed and not pick calls that we are not sure of.....
4/1/24, 9:27 AM - +91 78292 99422: Thank you for sharing
4/1/24, 12:26 PM - JRAnil: The guy who called me last month from customs sounded very authentic - claimed he is calling me from New Delhi International Airport customs department  and intimidated me to identify myself with my full name. When I refused to share my name - he again threatened me mentioning police’s involvement etc..
If anyone’s identity has been actually stolen to carry out these crimes - the local police actually gets intimated and gets involved by asking you to pay a visit to PS or they themselves might show up at your doorstep.

Residents - Just wanted to let you know that my driver Shivraj, who's been with me for the past two years, is now available for full-time work. I used to have him mainly for school runs, but since I'm switching to the school bus, I won't be needing his services anymore. He's been super reliable and I've never had any problems with him. He'll be free from mid-April onwards.
If anyone's interested, just contact him directly at 9739151413.

4/4/24, 10:12 AM - +91 97405 83964: ** Regarding Green waste disposal from Garden(s) and streets****
Hello Residents,
We pay considerable sum of money (in the figures of 40-50k per year) to transport and dispose the green waste. Objective is to reduce this cost and also reuse this waste to generate more manure. We are soliciting suggestions from all of you for this objective, below are the issues which we are currently facing:
1. To bulk transport this waste, we collect this in phase-2 last empty plots which has a danger of catching fire during summer months (a recent incident has happened).
2. Our vendor is increasing the dump cost and transportation cost year by year.
3. This year, our vendor is reluctant to take more waste and demanding much more money as they are running out of dumping locations.

Now coming to the *solutions*:
1. Earlier we had installed few green color cages (count is approx 8-10) to collect this waste and convert it to manure. Present number is not enough and we need at least 30 more such cages.
2. There was an idea of digging pits for collecting this waste, however for this all locations found to be infeasible because of risks of falling down in these pits. Plus these pits shall spoil the garden area asthetics.
3. Burning the waste is already ruled out because of pollution concerns.
If you have any other suggestions, please dm me. We plan to create a small sub-group to discuss the potential solutions. At the moment, we are thinking of solution 1).

-On Behalf o JRG Association
4/4/24, 10:54 AM - +91 96631 79337: Solution 1 looks best among all.

4/11/24, 8:43 AM - +91 98105 83337: I have a humble request to make. We moved in about 6 months back at villa 16 and since then every other morning if not every morning there is a waste food packet/food wrapped in fresh white paper of school notebook seen in our side set back area. This is fresh left over food. Seems someone  intends for it to be picked up with wet waste daily and is not taking proper care of putting it in a bin resulting in a cat picking it up and taking it along and eating it in our area. Villa 17 residents have the same problem and every day we need to get the area cleaned as it stinks. Today I had to wash it as it was stinking. Today's dish was Maggie 😊. Sharing a picture so one can identify. Appreciate if the individuals can take care of this

4/11/24, 10:35 AM - JrSrilakshmi: Dear Residents,
During our recent MC meeting, reference was made to our previous water conservation initiative, where we facilitated installation of Aerators in all the taps of individual  villas.  As an action item from this, here are some pointers for each villa occupant to review and reaffirm:
1.  Those who moved in lately and are not aware/have not installed these aerators, are advised to get them done at the earliest. Please contact the Estate Manager for any information/support on this.
2. Occupants of  Villas who have got the aerators installed are advised to check if they are working the way they are supposed to. If found defective, please replace and ensure that the maids are not removing them while washing utensils (no offense meant but this was reported earlier)
3. Villa occupants are also advised to check for leakages in commodes, sinks and any other water outlets.
As you are aware, our staff takes water consumption data on a monthly basis from the water metres installed at the unit level. The MC has decided to publish this report via Google drive for ready reference. Watch out for a separate note from Jayaram on this.

Additionally, to check for compliance,  Abhijit may come visiting some villas at random. Your support will help efficiently  manage the most precious gift of nature - Jeev Jal.
 Thanks - JRGSHOA

If you are struggling to  receive OTP, payment via Gpay or direction using Google map etc. Just call customer care 198 and let the call continue and finish all network related work. Dialing 198, will add you immediately under network.

For overhauling and major repairs they took the cycles and brought them back. The pick up and drop was not charged extra... I believe they had 12-13 cycles that needed services at their workshop in Domasandra.

4/25/24, 8:59 PM - +91 98805 00667: I am not sure about that - we have enough open parking if everyone parks atleast 1 car in their designated space.  Worst case, Association can chose to identify few additional common parking spaces (next to tennis court, near east gate etc) if needed. However, all of that is useful only if we get to parking atleast 1 vehicle in house parking without sacrificing lawn space….My 2 cents…
4/25/24, 9:01 PM - DrArunJR: Open to positive discussion
4/25/24, 9:04 PM - DrArunJR: There are about 30-35 extra car parking space and more families have more than one car. 
Hope this makes sense unless we have more designated areas.
4/25/24, 9:07 PM - JR103104Vivek: Voters will not be allowed to carry mobile phones inside the polling booth.

5/5/24, 10:04 PM - JRGopalReva: Hi All,

We are uncomfortable to walk around the society sometimes because of dogs being unleashed. I understand that they are pets and good to you and your family. In the past I have been attacked by a dog and it's scary. Think about elderly person and their heart conditions.

Please understand that their behaviour is not entirely in our control.

I kindly request not to unleash then while walking in the road and park.
5/5/24, 11:41 PM - +91 78292 22422: There is a bit of difference between a trained dog and an untrained dog. Possibilities of a Trained dogs going out of order are relatively less.  These dogs can be good on rescue or guide when opportunity arises if given a chance. But with leash the chances of them getting geared for situation is less since we restrict their movement. They sniff threat before we can see them. However all of these instincts gets tamed down when you leash. My dog is trained to no/ Stay/ Stop commands. I personally believe other species also have equal rights to the planet. However since a concern has been raised I will leash Argo till the gate.
5/6/24, 10:31 AM - +91 99866 14661: Any carpenters working in the society? Please share the contact.

5/9/24, 3:43 PM - Bhagavan: Dear Residents,

We are happy to announce the commencement of additional 15 Rain Water Harvest cum Recharge pits in select locations along the main road and the cross roads.🌧💧Additionally, a thorough cleanup of our existing 6 pits will be done to ensure they are in optimal condition for the purpose meant for. This project is handled by the same vendor (Munikrishna) who successfully completed our previous project in 2019. 

Some points to ponder:
1. Our previous pits were mainly focused on rejuvenating the existing borewells, which yielded the desired results and continue to support in spite of increased pressure from the multiple borewells drilled in the neighbouring land. 
2. Due to the changed scenario and the dynamics around, the advice from the experts was to focus on digging recharge pits in strategic locations away from the neighbouring land. The points chosen this time are in line with that advice. Apart from strengthening the ground water by way of continuous recharge during the rainy season, our objective is to look for drawing water from a shallow well (borewell that is of a depth up to 200 feet) in the near future.

This project marks a significant step towards sustainable water management within our community. By harnessing the power of rainwater and maintaining our current infrastructure, we aim to reduce our dependency on external water sources.

We intend to complete this activity before the end of this month and try to minimise inconvenience to the residents as much as possible.  Your support and cooperation is vital in making this activity a success. For any queries you may have, as always, do speak to Jayaram or drop a note to jrgassociation@gmail.com. Thanks

Best regards,
JRGSHOA

5/9/24, 5:37 PM - +91 97319 00776: No. it's working
5/9/24, 5:51 PM - +91 97405 83964: <Media omitted>
5/9/24, 7:50 PM - +91 98188 13370: Really Appreciate this initiative..
I was also trying say this earlier that " to focus on digging recharge pits in strategic locations away from the neighbouring land"

This means that the actual pits that will recharge water for us will be away from 5th and 6th cross. I would request to intensify this drive and in case it is required we (people from such villas, who's own pit cant help much) can contribute financially to help dig more  and more pits. I feel the main problem is next year when all these PGs will be operational.

So lets all try to dig even more pits to decided areas and we all can contribute amounts as society project than only for those individual pits owners.

Once again thank you to all who are involved in this 🙏🙏🙏
5/9/24, 7:51 PM - +91 98188 13370: Also is it possible to divert rain water that overflows via road etc to these strategic pits? I don't have details but if possible better do that too. Thank you again
5/9/24, 8:49 PM - Bhagavan: Bhaskar, I'm reaching out to ask if you would consider joining the Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) committee.
We're eager to have your input, and to explore your suggestions further as we work towards implementation.
5/9/24, 8:51 PM - Bhagavan: @918050403007 , Can you please forward the RWH Committee Link (WhatsApp) to Bhaskar? <This message was edited>
5/10/24, 12:28 PM - JRRahulTaneja: Greetings,

We'd like to inform everyone that JR has successfully acquired *two* new MyGate devices for phases 3 and 4, and has also sanitized the residents' database accordingly. Therefore, it is anticipated that MyGate approval requests for phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 should not overlap hereon.

If you notice any incorrect approval requests on MyGate, please notify the MC Team immediately so that we can initiate corrections in the directory.

Thank you,
MC Team

5/13/24, 10:17 AM - JRAnil: This person is at the main gate - should anyone need his services.
5/13/24, 11:10 AM - Bhagavan: Dear Residents,

Our phase 1 borewell is experiencing a significant strain due to a combination of factors, including prolonged heat wave conditions and unscientific drilling of borewells along our eastern compound wall. Water output is fast depleting and our primary source of water is about to go "totally dry" in the next couple of days. 

With immediate effect and until further notice, please note we are taking the following actions to address the situation:

1. *Activate the back up plan* - increase the daily tankers from the current vendor to such numbers as needed  to address the shortfall. Please note, this uptake will have an impact on the maintenance charges from now on. 
2. *Insist on judicious  usage*: We kindly ask all residents to use water wisely and conserve it during this challenging period. It's important to note that we've already taken two proactive measures viz., checking and fixing any leaks and providing aerators to help save water. Here are some steps you can take to help conserve water:

a. Limit outdoor water usage, such as watering lawns and washing cars.
b. Fix any leaks in faucets, taps or pipes promptly.
c. Take shorter showers and turn off the tap while brushing teeth, shaving and washing utensils.
d. Use water-efficient appliances and fixtures.
e. Educate your family members and house helps about the importance of water conservation.

3. *Implementation of Water Slabs*: In light of the seriousness of the situation, a system of water slabs will be implemented to effectively manage water usage. Note: The Water Management Sub-committee is currently working on defining these slabs and associated charges.
Note: MC *may decide* to reduce the frequency of water release from 3 to 2 times a week if the situation warrants

We urge everyone to be mindful of their water usage and to implement water-saving measures.  Your cooperation is of utmost importance to navigate through this challenging period with minimal disruption. 

Further updates will follow as the situation progresses or an emerging situation warrants. Thanks

Best regards,

5/13/24, 7:37 PM - PoornaJr127: DG is on
You can force switch to DG
5/13/24, 7:39 PM - JR18Jayakumar: I do not think so, as turning off the main-line is not getting the power thru dg
5/13/24, 7:41 PM - PoornaJr127: <Media omitted>

Checked with Bescom , line fault , single phase now.
They will rectify within one hour

And will switch on once main power is back
